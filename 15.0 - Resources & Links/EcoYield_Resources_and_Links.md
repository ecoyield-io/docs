# Resources & Links

This section provides quick access to EcoYield’s core resources —
official channels, investor materials, and technical documentation. It
also highlights where our internal team needs to insert final links and
files as they are published.

## Official Channels

\- 🌐 Website → \[Insert final URL once live\]  
- 🐦 Twitter/X → \[Insert official handle\]  
- 💬 Telegram Community → \[Insert invite link\]  
- 📖 GitHub Repository → \[Insert repo link for smart contracts &
audits\]  
- 📺 YouTube / Explainer Video → \[Insert once uploaded\]  
- 📧 Investor Relations Contact → \[Insert team email / contact form
link\]

Action: Team to add the final URLs once each channel is launched.

## Investor Collateral

\- Pitch Decks & One-Pagers → \[Upload PDF(s) here\]

Action: Keep all links set to view-only with clear version control.

## Legal & Compliance Docs

\- Notion Doc — Fee Breakdown & Tokenomics Update →
https://www.notion.so/Ecoyield-Tokenomics-Updates-23f7d2ec9ee680b6b4d8d5c50e0aa5ec?source=copy_link  
- Terms of Service → \[Insert final public version\]  
- Privacy Policy → \[Insert final public version\]  
- Risk Disclosure Statement → \[Insert final public version\]

Action: Confirm final compliance versions before publishing publicly.

## Data Room (Investor Access)

\- Notion Investor Data Room → \[Insert secure access link once
available\]  
Includes: Tokenomics, IRR models, project financials, legal docs.

Action: Investor access should remain gated; Gitbook can describe
contents but not expose confidential files.

✨ Reminder for Team:  
- Audit all links regularly (especially Google Docs/Sheets) for
permissions.  
- Ensure public Gitbook only contains investor-facing materials.  
- Keep private, confidential files gated via Notion or Data Room
invite-only links.
