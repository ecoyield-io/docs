# Safeguards

EcoYield’s DAO governance is designed to empower the community, but not at the expense of stability or security. To protect investor capital, maintain trust, and ensure long-term protocol resilience, a number of safeguards are built into the system.

## 1. Multisig Protection

* Until the DAO is fully decentralised, all treasury transactions and protocol upgrades are secured by a multi-signature wallet.
* This means that no single party (including the founders) can unilaterally move funds or make critical changes.
* Signers are chosen from the EcoYield core team, advisors, and trusted community members to ensure distributed responsibility.

## 2. Veto Mechanism

* A temporary veto right is maintained by the foundation during early phases.
* This prevents malicious or rushed proposals from harming the protocol before governance participation is fully matured.
* The veto power is designed to sunset once the DAO reaches a sufficient level of decentralisation and participation.

## 3. Cooldown Periods

* To avoid sudden governance shocks, all proposals that pass voting are subject to a cooldown period before execution.
* This creates a buffer for the community to review decisions, flag risks, and prepare for changes.
* Emergency proposals (e.g., security patches) can bypass cooldown with supermajority approval.

## 4. Insurance Vaults

* EcoYield establishes an insurance vault, funded from a portion of treasury revenue and performance fees.
* The vault serves as a financial safety net in the rare case of project underperformance, technical issues, or black swan events.
* Controlled by DAO governance, the insurance vault provides peace of mind to LP investors and underpins EcoYield’s credibility as a serious infrastructure protocol.

EcoYield balances community-driven governance with risk-managed safeguards. By combining multisig security, temporary veto power, cooldown delays, and an insurance vault, we ensure that governance remains democratic without ever compromising investor protection.
