# What the DAO Governs — Vaults, Treasury, Partnerships, Fees

EcoYield’s DAO exists to ensure that decision-making is decentralised,
transparent, and increasingly powered by AI-driven insights. By
progressively handing over governance to the community, EcoYield
guarantees that the protocol remains aligned with long-term
sustainability, fairness, and value creation.

## 1. Vault Governance

\- The DAO votes on the approval and oversight of new renewable energy +
GPU project vaults.  
- AI-powered due diligence reports (technical, financial, environmental)
will be provided to voters, improving the quality and efficiency of
decision-making.  
- Community members influence which projects get funded and prioritised.

## 2. Treasury Management

\- The DAO manages protocol revenues, including performance fees and
buybacks.  
- Treasury funds can be directed toward reinvestment in new projects,
liquidity support, or ecosystem growth.  
- AI-driven treasury tools model risk-adjusted returns and optimise
yield distribution strategies.

## 3. Protocol Upgrades & Fees

\- Members can propose and vote on changes to EcoYield’s protocol fees,
staking multipliers, and incentive structures.  
- AI simulations will allow the community to test the economic impact of
proposed changes before approval.  
- Ensures adaptability to evolving markets while safeguarding investor
confidence.

## 4. Ecosystem Partnerships

\- The DAO approves strategic partnerships with aligned ecosystems
(DePIN networks, AI marketplaces, ReFi projects, and ESG
collaborators).  
- Funding for grants, carbon credit integrations, or joint ventures can
be unlocked by community vote.  
- AI tools flag potential synergies and risks across new partnerships.

## 5. Yield Distribution & Staking Incentives

\- Governance includes oversight of how performance fees and treasury
yields are split between \$EYE buybacks, staking rewards, and protocol
reserves.  
- Members can adjust staking multipliers and lockup bonuses to keep
incentives competitive.  
- AI monitoring ensures fair distribution and long-term sustainability.

✨ The Big Picture  
By governing vault approvals, treasury use, partnerships, fees, and
yield distribution, the EcoYield DAO ensures that both early investors
and future participants remain aligned. Importantly, with AI assistance,
decision-making becomes more data-driven, transparent, and efficient —
building trust while scaling globally.
