# Voting Power ($EYE)

The $EYE token is the foundation of EcoYield’s governance. It transforms investors from passive participants into active decision-makers, ensuring that the protocol grows in line with the community’s vision and long-term sustainability goals.

## 1. Token as Governance Power

* Each $EYE token represents one unit of voting power.
* Holders can create, debate, and vote on proposals that shape the future of EcoYield.
* Governance is designed to be AI-assisted, with machine learning models helping forecast the impact of proposals on yield, TVL, and sustainability metrics.

## 2. Proposals

* Any wallet with a minimum threshold of $EYE tokens can submit a proposal.
* Proposals cover areas such as:
* Approval of new project vaults.
* Adjustments to performance or funding fees.
* Treasury allocations for buybacks, partnerships, or grants.
* Governance improvements and technical upgrades.

## 3. Quorum & Voting Thresholds

* To prevent governance capture, EcoYield enforces quorum rules:
* A minimum percentage of circulating $EYE must participate for a vote to be valid.
* Proposals require a simple majority for standard decisions and a higher supermajority for critical changes (e.g., treasury deployment or protocol upgrades).
* AI tools monitor voter participation and can help suggest adjustments to quorum to maintain fairness as the community scales.

## 4. Long-Term Incentives

* Locking $EYE tokens for longer periods can boost voting power, ensuring that committed stakeholders have greater influence.
* This aligns incentives between long-term holders, Yield Token providers, and the protocol’s growth.
* Early investors who lock tokens not only earn yield boosts but also play a stronger role in shaping the protocol’s direction.

In Summary The $EYE token gives every participant a voice in EcoYield’s future. With AI-enhanced governance, clear quorum rules, and incentives for long-term holders, voting power ensures decisions are transparent, democratic, and sustainable.
