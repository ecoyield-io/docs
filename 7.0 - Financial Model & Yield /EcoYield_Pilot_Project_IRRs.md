# Pilot Project IRRs — Leeds & Dubai

EcoYield’s pilot projects provide the first proof points for our yield
model, combining AI compute + renewable energy infrastructure. Each
project has been fully modelled with feasibility studies, IRR
projections, and deployment timelines.

## Leeds, UK — AI Compute + Solar (Pilot Site)

\- IRR (Gross): 35.29%  
- Deployment: 10 GPU modular compute units + 150kW rooftop solar.  
- Funding Requirement: £400,000.  
- Status: Land secured, planning permission and grid connection in
place, ready to deploy in 6 weeks post-funding.  
- Revenue Drivers: GPU leasing contracts, excess energy sales to the
grid.  
- Purpose: Demonstrates the EcoYield model in a controlled UK market,
creating the first vault for LP investors.

## Dubai, UAE — AI Compute + Solar + Battery Storage (Flagship Project)

\- IRR (Gross): 43.40%  
- Deployment: 100 GPU modular compute units + 800kW solar farm + 2MWh
battery energy storage system (BESS).  
- Funding Requirement: £3.25M.  
- Status: Site identified, feasibility studies completed, 18-week
deployment timeline.  
- Revenue Drivers: GPU wholesale leasing, long-term solar PPA
agreements, energy storage arbitrage.  
- Purpose: Larger-scale flagship project that validates global
scalability and stronger yields from combining compute + renewables in
the GCC.

✨ Why This Matters  
- Leeds proves the concept at small scale, with low capex and quick
deployment.  
- Dubai scales the model significantly, delivering higher IRR and
positioning EcoYield for global replication.  
- Together, these pilots underpin the real-world, yield-backed
foundation of the EcoYield ecosystem.
