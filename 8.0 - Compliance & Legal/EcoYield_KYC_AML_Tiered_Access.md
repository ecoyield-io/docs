# KYC/AML Process — Tiered Access

At EcoYield, compliance is a priority — but it should never be a
barrier. Our KYC/AML framework is designed to align with global
standards (FATF, MiCA, UAE regulations) while keeping participation as
smooth and accessible as possible.

We apply a tiered, risk-based approach that scales with the level of
investment:

## Tier 0 — Fast Onboarding

• Entry-level access with minimal requirements.  
• Designed for smaller contributions and global accessibility.

## Tier 1 — Verified Participants

• Requires basic ID verification.  
• Suitable for most retail investors.

## Tier 2 — Institutional Access

• Full compliance checks (ID, AML screening, proof of address).  
• Required for larger allocations, funds, and strategic partners.

## Why This Matters

• Low resistance: Smaller investors can get started quickly.  
• Scalable: The more capital committed, the more rigorous the checks.  
• Global alignment: Matches the principles of FATF and MiCA without
unnecessary friction.  
• Future-proof: Thresholds can be adapted as regulation evolves and
EcoYield scales.

## Implementation Principles

• Soft Gating: Investors can explore the platform before KYC;
verification is required only before yield-bearing LP tokens are
issued.  
• Progressive Triggers: Additional checks are requested only as
allocations increase or if activity looks suspicious.  
• Transparency by Design: Smart contracts and oracles provide audit
trails, giving regulators and investors confidence.

⚡ EcoYield’s approach ensures compliance while protecting
accessibility. KYC is required only where it matters — for yield-bearing
LP tokens — so the protocol remains inclusive, secure, and future-ready.
