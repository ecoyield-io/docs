# Glossary of Key Terms

EcoYield bridges the worlds of renewable infrastructure and decentralised finance. To make our model accessible, here is a clear glossary of terms you’ll see throughout this Gitbook.

## TVL (Total Value Locked)

The total amount of capital (e.g., stablecoins) deposited into EcoYield’s vaults. Higher TVL = stronger protocol scale and credibility.

## LP Tokens (Liquidity Provider Tokens)

Digital tokens investors receive when depositing into EcoYield vaults. LP tokens represent ownership of real-world infrastructure projects (GPU farms + renewable energy). They entitle holders to proportional yield flows.

## APY (Annual Percentage Yield)

The projected annual return for investors, factoring in compounding. EcoYield targets 25–35% APY depending on project IRRs and demand.

## RWA (Real-World Assets)

Physical, tangible assets that are tokenised on-chain. For EcoYield: solar farms, batteries, and GPU data centres. Unlike speculative tokens, RWAs anchor yield to infrastructure.

## DePIN (Decentralised Physical Infrastructure Networks)

A Web3 model where communities fund, build, and share ownership of physical infrastructure (compute, energy, telecoms). EcoYield is a DePIN project for AI compute + renewables.

## TGE (Token Generation Event)

The formal launch of EcoYield’s $EYE token, when allocations are unlocked and become transferable. TGE ensures liquidity and confidence but is only one part of EcoYield’s growth plan.

## PPA (Power Purchase Agreement)

A long-term energy contract where buyers (utilities or corporates) agree to purchase renewable energy at a fixed rate. EcoYield’s solar + battery systems use PPAs to lock in predictable revenues.

## DAO (Decentralised Autonomous Organisation)

A community-led governance system where $EYE holders vote on protocol decisions such as new project vaults, treasury allocation, and ecosystem partnerships.

## IRR (Internal Rate of Return)

A financial metric used to measure the profitability of EcoYield’s projects (e.g., Leeds IRR = 31%, Dubai IRR = 27%).

## KYC/AML (Know Your Customer / Anti-Money Laundering)

Regulatory checks that verify investor identities and prevent misuse of funds. EcoYield uses tiered, lightweight KYC to stay compliant while reducing friction for global investors.

## Fee Hurdle (Performance Benchmark)

The minimum annual return that EcoYield projects must exceed before step‑up performance fees apply. The benchmark is set by the DAO and reviewed quarterly; it reflects the average net yield of comparable clean‑energy and GPU‑leasing projects in OECD markets. For every 1 percentage point a project’s net yield exceeds this benchmark, the performance fee increases by 0.5 percentage points.

## Buyback

When the EcoYield treasury uses protocol fees to purchase $EYE tokens from the market, supporting token value and rewarding stakers.

By making terms simple and transparent, EcoYield empowers both seasoned crypto investors and newcomers to understand how real-world yield is generated.
