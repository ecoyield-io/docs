# Investor ROI Calculator; Guide to Use

The EcoYield Investor ROI Calculator is a purpose-built tool designed to
help prospective and current investors understand the potential
financial outcomes of participating in our presale and project vaults.
It allows users to model different investment amounts, token
allocations, and project yields, providing a clear view of both short-
and long-term returns.

## Key Features

- Customisable Inputs: Enter your intended investment amount, token
tier, and presale stage.
- Automatic ROI Projections: See projected returns based on presale
discounts, token appreciation, and project yield distribution.
- Tier-Based Scenarios: Compare different presale tiers and how they
impact ROI (e.g. Private Seed at $0.015 vs. Presale Tier 1 at
$0.025).
- Vault Yield Integration: Model LP token allocations and expected APY
from project vaults (25–35% typical).
- Equity Add-On (if applicable): Certain rounds include equity exposure,
which can also be modelled.
- Exit Strategy Options: Factor in vesting, lock-ups, and potential
redemption/buyback pathways.

credibility. Instead of vague promises, we give investors a clear,
data-backed model to evaluate their decision-making. By combining
presale structure, yield mechanics, and vesting design, the tool
demonstrates how EcoYield creates sustainable, real-world returns, not
speculative hype.
