# How Yield is Generated; GPU Leasing + Clean Energy

EcoYield is designed to provide real yield; not speculative emissions
or inflationary rewards. Every dollar of return comes from two tangible,
revenue-backed sources:

## 1. GPU Leasing (Primary Yield Source)

- EcoYield deploys modular GPU farms equipped with high-performance
hardware (e.g. NVIDIA H100s).
- These GPUs are leased to:
- AI model developers and LLM teams.
- Enterprise AI workloads.
- Decentralised GPU marketplaces (such as Render, Akash, Bittensor).
- Leasing contracts generate predictable, high-demand cashflow, which
flows back to EcoYield LP vaults.
- Target returns from GPU leasing are ~25–35% APY, creating the
foundation for EcoYield’s yield model.

## 2. Clean Energy Revenue (Secondary Yield Source)

- Each compute farm is powered by renewable solar + battery
infrastructure designed for efficiency and scalability.
- Clean energy is monetised in two ways:
- Offsetting compute OpEx, reducing costs and improving net yield.
- Selling excess power back to the grid through long-term Power Purchase
Agreements (PPAs).
- This provides a low-risk, stable income stream tied to regulated
energy markets.

## 3. Combined Yield Distribution

- The revenue from GPU leasing and clean energy sales flows into
project vaults.
- LP token holders earn yield directly from these real-world
cashflows.
- Additional upside comes from the $EYE token, which captures protocol
performance fees and redistributes them via buybacks and staking
rewards.

The Result:
EcoYield’s investors earn yield that is stable, transparent, and
asset-backed; driven by global demand for AI compute and renewable
energy, not speculation.
