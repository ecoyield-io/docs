# Roadmap

EcoYield’s growth plan is designed to balance speed, execution credibility, and investor confidence. Each phase builds on real infrastructure deployment, growing TVL, and progressive decentralisation through the EcoYield DAO.

## Phase 1 - Q3–Q4 2025: Foundation & Presale

* Private Seed Round & Public Presale (10-phase tiered structure).
* Investor incentives: early presale funds tied directly to pilot project deployment, with LP allocations distributed upon project go-live.
* Token Generation Event (TGE) immediately after presale close → ensures liquidity and market confidence.
* First pilot project: Leeds, UK (10 GPUs + 150kW solar).
* DAO multisig governance begins for core operations.

## Phase 2 - Q1–Q2 2026: Flagship Deployment (UAE)

* Deploy Dubai flagship project: 100 GPUs, 800kW solar + 2MWh battery.
* Launch secondary markets for LP tokens → enabling liquidity and structured exits.
* Expand marketing flywheel (Coinpresso 3:1 ROAS + KOL partnerships) to accelerate TVL growth.
* $EYE token live with staking + yield boost utility.

## Phase 3 - Q3–Q4 2026: Global Scaling & Institutional Onboarding

* Rollout additional renewable-powered compute farms across the UK, UAE, and new geographies.
* Explore corporate partnerships with AI labs and decentralised GPU networks (Render, Akash, Bittensor).
* Carbon credit integration → projects generate certified credits for additional revenue.
* Pilot LP secondary trading module and insurance vaults under DAO governance.

## Phase 4 - Q1–Q2 2027: DAO Expansion

* Community DAO activation with transferable $EYE governance.
* Treasury oversight shifts from multisig to DAO treasury management.
* Members gain proposal/voting rights on new vaults, treasury allocation, and ecosystem partnerships.
* Full transparency on protocol revenues, buybacks, and performance fees.

## Phase 5 - Q3–Q4 2027: Full Decentralisation & Institutional Scale

* EcoYield operates as a decentralised infrastructure investment platform.
* DAO governs all new vault approvals, treasury allocations, and protocol upgrades.
* Expanded portfolio of global compute + renewable projects under management.
* Target milestone: $1bn+ AUM, positioning EcoYield as the first “digital BlackRock” for tokenised clean energy + AI compute.

EcoYield’s roadmap is simple but ambitious: build real yield projects, compound TVL, and progressively decentralise into a global DAO.
