# ✅ Milestones Achieved

EcoYield has already laid a strong foundation, proving this is not just
an idea — it’s a project with real progress, assets, and infrastructure
in place.

## 1. Land Ownership & Planning Approvals

\- Secured land in the UK for our first AI compute + renewable energy
pilot project.

governance.  
- EcoYield MENA FZ-LLC (UAE): Regional HQ for partnerships and
delivery.

SPVs.  
- Vault SPVs: Created for each project to ring-fence liability and
ownership.

## 3. Tokenomics & Governance Model

\- Completed detailed tokenomics model, vesting schedule, and fee
structure.  
- Governance design finalised with phased DAO rollout (multisig → DAO
activation → full treasury control).

mechanisms.

## 4. Team Formation

Web3 tokenomics, and venture scaling.

✨ These milestones show EcoYield is already de-risked at an early
stage. With land, legal entities, tokenomics, and MVP infrastructure in
place, we are ready to move into capital deployment and scale.
