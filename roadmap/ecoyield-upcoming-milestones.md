# Upcoming Milestones

EcoYield is entering its next phase of growth with a series of
milestones designed to validate our model, scale participation, and
decentralise governance. Each step strengthens investor confidence and
demonstrates the real-world performance of our renewable-powered AI
compute platform.

## 1. First Yield Distributions (Q1–Q2 2026)

\- Pilot projects (Leeds, UK and Dubai, UAE) will begin generating yield
from GPU leasing and clean energy sales.  
- LP token holders will receive their first stablecoin distributions,
proving EcoYield’s real-world cashflow model.  
- Transparent on-chain reporting will validate gross IRRs against
projections (~25–35% APY).

## 2. Secondary LP Markets (Q2–Q3 2026)

\- Launch of internal/partnered secondary markets for LP tokens.  
- Enables investors to trade their project allocations, increasing
liquidity and flexibility.  
- Attracts new participants who prefer liquid exposure to yield-bearing
assets.

## 3. DAO Activation (Q3–Q4 2026)

\- Transition from multisig-controlled treasury to community
governance.  
- Non-transferable governance rights for early investors evolve into
full \$EYE voting power.  
- DAO begins managing treasury allocations, buybacks, and new project
approvals.

## 4. Expanded Portfolio (2026 → 2027)

\- Additional modular GPU + solar projects deployed in Europe, MENA, and
beyond.  
- Each new vault compounds the EcoYield flywheel: More TVL → More Yield
→ Rising \$EYE Demand → Growth.  
- Builds toward EcoYield’s long-term vision of a decentralised,
multi-billion AUM infrastructure platform.

✨ Why This Matters  
These milestones demonstrate that EcoYield is not a speculative token
launch but a real, revenue-generating business. By tying every phase to
tangible deployment and decentralised governance, we are building a
sustainable platform where investors earn reliable yield today while
shaping the future of AI infrastructure tomorrow.
