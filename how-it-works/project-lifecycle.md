# Project Lifecycle

Every EcoYield project follows a clear, transparent lifecycle from proposal to yield distribution. This ensures that capital is only deployed into high-quality, thoroughly vetted infrastructure projects.

### Submission & Review

Projects are submitted to the DAO and reviewed for eligibility. An independent feasibility study (technical, financial, and compliance checks) ensures viability before approval.

### Funding

Once approved, projects are listed on the EcoYield platform for investors to commit capital. If the funding target is not reached, Yield Tokens are refunded.

### Preparation

When the target is met, EcoYield collects a small structuring fee and sets up the project SPV. Equipment is procured and installed, preparing the project to go live.

### Yield Generation

The project begins generating dual yield from GPU leasing and renewable energy sales. Yields are distributed to Yield Token holders. EcoYield charges a performance fee, which is split evenly between $EYE token buybacks and the protocol treasury.

### Impact & Metrics

The success of each project is measured by:\


* TVL: Growth in committed capital.
* Volume: Cash flow through the protocol.
* Users: Number of participants.
* Token Utility: How $EYE drives access, governance, and rewards.

## Why This Matters

EcoYield ensures that investor capital is only deployed into credible, viable, revenue-generating projects. This keeps the ecosystem transparent, protects Yield Tokens, and aligns long-term growth with community oversight.
