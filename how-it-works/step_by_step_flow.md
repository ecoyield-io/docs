# Step-by-Step Flow

From presale contribution → project deployment → LP allocations → yield
distribution

EcoYield makes it simple for investors to see exactly how their capital
flows through the ecosystem:

## 1. Presale Contribution

\- Investors join EcoYield during the private or public presale.  
- In return, they receive \$EYE tokens (governance, access priority, and
yield boosts).  
- A portion of presale proceeds funds the first pilot projects (e.g.,
Leeds, Dubai).

## 2. Project Deployment

\- Presale funds finance modular, renewable-powered AI compute sites
(GPU + solar + battery).  
- Projects are structured via independent SPVs for security and
transparency.  
- Once live, they generate two cashflows:  
• GPU leasing to AI companies.  
• Clean-energy sales (PPAs or grid).

## 3. LP Token Allocation

\- When projects go live, presale participants receive proportional LP
tokens tied to those vaults.  
- LP tokens are asset-backed by deployed infrastructure, not
speculation.  
- Holding LP tokens entitles investors to ongoing stablecoin yield.

## 4. Yield Distribution

\- Revenues from GPUs + energy flow back into the vaults.  
- LP holders receive their share of yield, distributed transparently
on-chain.  
- \$EYE staking boosts APY and provides governance power.

## Why This Matters

By tying presale contributions directly to project deployment, EcoYield
ensures early investors are first in line for real-world yield. The
model is scalable across multiple vaults, creating a repeatable
pathway:  
  
Capital → Infrastructure → LP tokens → Yield.
