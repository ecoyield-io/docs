# Step-by-Step Flow

From presale contribution → project deployment → Yield Token allocations → yield distribution

EcoYield makes it simple for investors to see exactly how their capital flows through the ecosystem:

## 1. Presale Contribution

* Investors join EcoYield during the private or public presale.
* In return, they receive $EYE tokens (governance, access priority, and yield boosts).
* A portion of presale proceeds funds the first pilot projects (e.g., Leeds, Dubai).

## 2. Project Deployment

* Presale funds finance modular, renewable-powered AI compute sites (GPU + solar + battery).
* Projects are structured via independent SPVs for security and transparency.
* Once live, they generate two cashflows:
* GPU leasing to AI companies.
* Clean-energy sales (PPAs or grid).

## 3. Yield Token Allocation

* When projects go live, presale participants receive proportional Yield Tokens tied to those vaults.
* Yield Tokens are asset-backed by deployed infrastructure, not speculation.
* Holding Yield Tokens entitles investors to ongoing stablecoin yield.

## 4. Yield Distribution

* Revenues from GPUs + energy flow back into the vaults.
* Yield Token holders receive their share of yield, distributed transparently on-chain.
* $EYE staking boosts APY and provides governance power.

## Why This Matters

By tying presale contributions directly to project deployment, EcoYield ensures early investors are first in line for real-world yield. The model is scalable across multiple vaults, creating a repeatable pathway:

Capital → Infrastructure → Yield Tokens → Yield.
