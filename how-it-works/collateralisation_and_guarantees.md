# Collateralisation & Guarantees

EcoYield is designed to give investors confidence that their capital is
protected and tied to real, productive infrastructure. Each project is
structured in a way that secures funds, minimises risk, and ensures
transparency.

## How Projects Are Structured

- Each renewable + GPU project is ring-fenced inside its own Special
Purpose Vehicle (SPV).
- Investor capital flows into the SPV, which owns the land lease,
equipment, and revenue contracts.
- This ensures that investor funds are directly tied to physical assets
and cashflows, not just token promises.

## Collateralisation

- Asset-Backed → Every LP Token is backed by real-world infrastructure
(GPU hardware, solar arrays, battery systems).
- Revenue-Linked → LP Tokens entitle holders to yield generated from GPU
leasing contracts and clean energy sales.
- On-Chain Proof → All vaults and project flows are transparent and
auditable via smart contracts.

## Guarantees & Risk Mitigation

- Pre-Vetted Projects → All sites undergo feasibility studies (via
independent partners) before fundraising begins.
- Insurance → EcoYield will explore insurance coverage for both
equipment (GPU + solar hardware) and revenue (PPA agreements, downtime
protection).
- Multi-Sig Treasury → Funds are secured in multisig-controlled wallets
until deployment milestones are met.
- DAO Oversight → As the DAO matures, governance will vote on new vault
approvals and treasury allocations.

## Why This Matters to Investors

This structure ensures that:
- Capital is never free-floating; it is collateralised by tangible
assets.
- Yield comes from real activity; compute + energy sales; not
speculation.
- Projects are de-risked via feasibility studies, independent audits,
and transparent on-chain reporting.

✨ EcoYield isn’t vaporware. It’s a protocol backed by hard assets, real
contracts, and governance safeguards; giving investors true confidence
in the durability of their yield.
