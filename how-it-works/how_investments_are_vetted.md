# How Investments Are Vetted

EcoYield ensures that every project listed on the platform goes through a rigorous due diligence and vetting process. This protects investor capital, builds confidence, and ensures only high-quality, revenue-generating assets enter the ecosystem.

## 1. Feasibility Studies

* Each project begins with a technical and financial feasibility study, analysing the site’s solar potential, grid connection, fibre availability, and compute economics.
* Early-stage studies and financial models are carried out directly by EcoYield co-founder Jordan Myers’ Web2 companies:
* JLM Energy UK (www.jlmenergy.co.uk) & JLM Energy UAE (www.jlmenergy.ae) → expertise in renewable energy deployment and engineering.
* Deseco (www.deseco.co.uk) → design consultancy specialising in mechanical, electrical, and infrastructure projects.
* This ensures that in the project’s early phases, proven engineering teams with real-world delivery experience validate the numbers.
* As EcoYield scales, independent partners and globally recognised technical auditors will be involved to strengthen credibility and investor trust.

## 2. Financial Modelling

* Each project is modelled for IRR, cash flow, and downside scenarios, with outputs shared transparently in the data room.
* Models are stress-tested against variables such as GPU pricing, energy volatility, and PPA terms.
* Results are presented in clear, investor-ready formats.

## 3. Technical Audits

* Independent engineers and auditors validate feasibility assumptions, equipment specs, and deployment timelines.
* This ensures that capex, opex, and yield projections are grounded in reality, not just optimistic forecasts.

## 4. Governance & DAO Oversight

* In the early stages, the EcoYield core team and multisig signers make final approval decisions.
* As the DAO matures, the community will gain governance power to vote on which projects enter the vaults.
* This ensures that investors themselves participate in vetting future projects.

## Investor Confidence

By combining:

* Hands-on feasibility work from trusted Web2 companies in the UK & UAE in the early phases, and
* Independent audits and DAO governance as the platform scales,

EcoYield creates a layered, robust investment vetting process that balances speed with accuracy, and vision with accountability.

Investors know that every vault they participate in is backed by due diligence, transparent modelling, and expert oversight not hype.
