# Phased DAO Rollout — Foundation → Advisory → Community → Treasury DAO

EcoYield’s DAO is designed to evolve gradually, ensuring that
decentralisation grows in step with project maturity, investor
protection, and AI integration. Rather than rushing into a fragile
“instant DAO,” we prioritise stability and progressive community
empowerment.

## Phase 1 — Foundation (Q3–Q4 2025)

\- Core operations managed by the founding team and secured through
multisig wallets.  
- Early projects (Leeds pilot + platform launch) executed directly by
the team for speed and reliability.  
- Compliance, legal frameworks, and KYC/AML safeguards embedded from the
outset.  
- AI-powered monitoring tools provide real-time project and financial
oversight, preparing for later decentralisation.

## Phase 2 — Advisory DAO (Q1–Q2 2026)

\- Introduction of non-transferable governance tokens for early
investors and advisors.  
- Advisory voting rights on project vault approvals, yield
distributions, and early treasury allocations.  
- \$EYE token utility begins (staking, governance boosts, and access
priority).  
- AI governance tools deployed for proposal risk analysis and yield
optimisation.

## Phase 3 — Community DAO (Q3–Q4 2026)

\- Transition to public DAO governance with transferable \$EYE tokens.  
- Community proposal rights on vault launches, protocol changes, and
ecosystem partnerships.  
- DAO treasury expands from performance fees, partially redirected into
\$EYE buybacks.  
- Secondary LP token market launched under DAO oversight.  
- AI-powered community tools (proposal curation, voting simulations,
treasury dashboards) enhance decision-making and transparency.

## Phase 4 — Treasury DAO (Q3–Q4 2027)

\- DAO treasury assumes full control of protocol-level capital, yield
skims, and buybacks.  
- DAO votes govern scaling into new geographies and project types.  
- Insurance integrations and carbon credit modules brought under DAO
governance.  
- EcoYield operates as a fully decentralised, AI-augmented
infrastructure investment fund owned and steered by its global
community.

✨ Why This Matters  
This phased rollout ensures EcoYield governance grows with the protocol.
Each phase adds more decentralisation, AI-driven intelligence, and
community power — while preserving security, investor trust, and
operational excellence. By the time the DAO holds full treasury control,
EcoYield will already be a proven, revenue-driven platform with a strong
foundation.
