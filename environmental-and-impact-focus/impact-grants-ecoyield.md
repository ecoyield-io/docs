# Impact Grants; DAO Treasury Allocation to Sustainability Projects

EcoYield is not only focused on generating yield for investors, but also
on amplifying its positive impact through sustainability-focused grants.
By dedicating a portion of the DAO treasury to fund aligned initiatives,
EcoYield ensures that capital flows back into projects that benefit both
communities and the environment.

## How It Works

- Treasury Allocation: A percentage of EcoYield’s protocol revenue
(performance fees, buybacks, etc.) is set aside within the DAO
treasury.
- DAO Governance: $EYE token holders vote on which sustainability
initiatives receive funding, ensuring transparent, community-driven
allocation.
- Project Types: Impact grants can support renewable microgrids, carbon
reduction initiatives, reforestation, or energy access programs in
underserved regions.

## Why Impact Grants Matter

- Amplifying ESG Value: Beyond individual project yields, EcoYield
becomes a driver of broader environmental and social good.
- Community-Driven: Token holders have a direct say in which causes are
prioritised, aligning financial returns with shared values.
- Brand Differentiation: Demonstrates EcoYield’s commitment to
measurable impact, setting it apart from purely profit-driven protocols.
