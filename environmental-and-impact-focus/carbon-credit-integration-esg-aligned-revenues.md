# Carbon Credit Integration; ESG-Aligned Revenues

EcoYield is built not only to generate yield but to deliver measurable
environmental benefits. One of the most powerful ways we achieve this is
through the integration of carbon credits into our project model,
creating ESG-aligned revenues that enhance both investor returns and
sustainability outcomes.

## How Carbon Credits Work

- Every unit of renewable energy generated by EcoYield projects
displaces carbon-intensive energy sources such as coal or gas.
- These avoided emissions can be quantified, verified, and certified as
carbon credits through trusted standards and partners.
- Carbon credits represent 1 tonne of CO₂ equivalent emissions reduced,
avoided, or removed.

## Carbon Credits in EcoYield

- Revenue Stream: Verified credits can be sold on voluntary carbon
markets, creating an additional cashflow alongside GPU leasing and clean
energy sales.
- ESG Value: Projects gain an environmental premium, appealing to
institutions and investors with sustainability mandates.
- On-Chain Reporting: Through blockchain oracles, carbon offset data can
be made transparent and auditable directly on-chain.

## Partners & Verification

EcoYield plans to collaborate with established carbon accounting
platforms (e.g., WattCarbon) to ensure credits are independently
verified and fully traceable. This ensures credibility and prevents
“greenwashing.”

## Why It Matters

- Adds a third revenue stream to EcoYield’s model, alongside GPU
leasing and renewable energy sales.
- Aligns EcoYield with global ESG investment frameworks, attracting
institutional capital.
- Ensures every project is not just profitable, but measurably
contributing to global decarbonisation.

✨ Carbon credits transform EcoYield’s projects into ESG-aligned
infrastructure, combining financial returns with environmental impact.
Investors don’t just earn yieldthey fund the clean energy transition.
