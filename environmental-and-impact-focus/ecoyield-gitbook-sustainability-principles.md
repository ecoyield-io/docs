# Sustainability Principles

At EcoYield, sustainability is not an afterthought; it is the foundation of our model. Every GPU compute farm we deploy is designed to be powered primarily by renewable energy from day one, ensuring that the infrastructure fueling AI growth contributes positively to the planet.

## Renewable First Design

* All EcoYield projects integrate solar PV and battery storage as the primary energy source.
* Clean energy is used first to power GPU compute farms, ensuring reduced reliance on fossil fuels.
* Excess renewable power is sold back to the grid under long-term PPAs, creating both revenue and environmental benefit.

## Efficiency & Smart Integration

* Modular, containerised GPU farms are co-located with renewable sites to minimise transmission losses.
* Advanced energy management systems balance GPU demand with solar and battery output for maximum efficiency.
* Backup energy sources are only used when renewable capacity is exceeded, reducing carbon intensity to the lowest possible levels.

## ESG Alignment

* Projects are structured to meet ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) benchmarks recognised by institutional investors.
* Independent reporting partners (e.g., WattCarbon) validate carbon offset and reduction metrics, ensuring EcoYield projects generate measurable environmental impact.
* Carbon credits derived from renewable deployments may be integrated into EcoYieldâ€™s yield streams, further strengthening the sustainability value proposition.

## Scalable Positive Impact

* Each new deployment scales both financial and environmental impact.
* As EcoYield grows its pipeline across the UK, EU, and GCC, every site adds capacity for clean power generation and carbon displacement.
* Our long-term ambition is to help accelerate the energy transition, building $1bn+ in clean, yield-bearing assets by 2030.
