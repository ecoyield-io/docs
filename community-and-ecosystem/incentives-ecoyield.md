# Incentives — Early Vouchers, Referral Schemes, Staking Boosts

EcoYield rewards early participation and long-term commitment through a
range of tailored incentives. These are designed to build momentum in
the early phases, create network effects, and maximise yield
opportunities for engaged community members.

## 1. Early Investor Incentives

\- Pre-sale participants receive priority LP allocations in the first
pilot projects (e.g., Leeds, Dubai).  
- By tying a portion of pre-sale funds directly to project deployment,
early backers enjoy a first-mover advantage: once projects go live, they
receive proportional LP tokens tied to yield-bearing infrastructure.  
- This ensures early capital is rewarded with both discounted \$EYE
tokens and direct exposure to real-world project returns.

## 2. Referral Schemes

\- EcoYield will roll out a referral rewards programme to encourage
organic community growth.  
- Participants who introduce new verified investors receive additional
\$EYE tokens or LP allocation boosts, depending on the stage of the
campaign.  
- This creates a network effect, where every supporter becomes an
advocate for EcoYield, expanding reach and accelerating TVL growth.

## 3. Staking Boosts

\- Locking \$EYE tokens not only increases governance power but also
boosts APY on LP tokens.  
- Boost multipliers are based on lock-up duration (e.g., ×1.5 for 3
months, up to ×4 for 12 months).  
- Long-term stakers enjoy:  
• Higher yields from project vaults.  
• Priority access to future vaults during high-demand sales.  
- This creates strong alignment: the more committed a participant is,
the greater their long-term rewards.

✨ Why This Matters  
EcoYield’s incentive design ensures that early adopters, community
advocates, and long-term believers all benefit disproportionately. By
combining early vouchers, referrals, and staking boosts, the protocol
builds a loyal, expanding community while rewarding those who help drive
its early growth.
