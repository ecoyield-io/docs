# Partnerships

EcoYield’s strength lies not only in its infrastructure but also in the strategic partnerships that extend our reach and credibility across both Web3 and traditional energy sectors. These partnerships ensure that our projects are fully integrated into the AI compute ecosystem while leveraging trusted renewable providers for scalability and reliability.&#x20;

EcoYield sits at the centre of this delivery ecosystem functioning as the investment marketplace, data hub, and revenue distribution engine, connecting investors, engineers, and asset operators through a single transparent digital layer.

## AI Compute Partnerships

### High-Level Deployment Flow

1. **Originate** — C-Quel identifies commercial or institutional decarbonisation projects.
2. **Design & Validate** — Deseco models technical and financial feasibility; EcoYield underwrites for listing.
3. **Fund** — Investors (via EcoYield platform) and partners like Accredica/SDC Capital provide capital into the Project Vault. Capital releases to partners upon verified milestone completion—equipment procurement, construction progress, commissioning—ensuring funds tie to real deployment progress.
4. **Build & Deploy** — JLM Energy constructs the renewable system; Huawei provides PV/BESS hardware; EcoBlox installs GPU containers.
5. **Verify** — WattCarbon validates live generation and carbon data; EcoYield records and publishes results on-chain.
6. **Yield & Govern** — EcoYield smart contracts distribute returns (USDC/$EYE); DAO governs reinvestment and scaling.

### Risk & Accountability

EcoYield mitigates partner and execution risk through:

* **Multi-party verification** — Deseco designs, JLM builds, WattCarbon verifies
* **Milestone-based releases** — capital unlocks only after verified progress
* **Insurance-backed guarantees** — via Accredica structuring
* **DAO oversight** — community votes on project continuation if issues arise

### EcoYield's Core Role

EcoYield is the critical centrepiece — the digital and financial layer that:

* Connects global investors with verified physical assets,
* Automates capital flow, monitoring, and yield distribution,
* Anchors compliance and data integrity through partner integrations, and
* Scales the model globally by replicating this workflow across new geographies and partnerships.

## Why Partnerships Matter

* Credibility: Backed by globally recognised names across both AI compute and renewable energy.
* Demand Assurance: Multiple integration pathways guarantee GPU leasing demand.
* Execution Power: Trusted partners with proven track records in infrastructure deployment.
* Scalability: Ecosystem designed to scale site-by-site across the UK, EU, GCC, and beyond.
