# How to Participate

EcoYield is designed to be open and accessible, allowing both retail and
institutional investors to contribute capital, earn yield, and take part
in governance. There are four main ways to participate in the ecosystem:

## 1. Presale Participation

- Join the EcoYield presale and secure $EYE tokens at the earliest
tiered price levels.
- A portion of presale funds is deployed directly into the first pilot
projects (e.g., Leeds, Dubai), ensuring early participants are directly
tied to real infrastructure.
- Once projects go live, presale investors receive LP token allocations
proportionate to their contribution, giving them early access to
yield-bearing assets.
- Benefits include: discounted $EYE entry price, early LP allocations,
and access to long-term upside.

## 2. Staking $EYE Tokens

- $EYE holders can lock their tokens to:
- Boost yields earned on LP tokens.
- Gain priority access to new project vaults.
- Participate in DAO governance.
- Longer staking periods = higher multipliers, rewarding long-term
commitment.

## 3. LP Vaults (Yield-Bearing Tokens)

- Investors deposit stablecoins (USDC/USDT) into project vaults.
- In return, they receive LP tokens that represent their share of the
vault and its revenues.
- LP tokens are backed by real assets; GPU compute farms, solar, and
battery systems; and yield is paid in stablecoins (target 25–35%
APY).
- Over time, secondary markets for LP tokens will provide liquidity and
structured exit options.

## 4. DAO Participation

- As EcoYield decentralises, governance shifts to the community through
the EcoYield DAO.
- $EYE token holders will be able to:
- Vote on new project vault approvals.
- Influence treasury allocation, buybacks, and grant programmes.
- Shape protocol upgrades and ecosystem partnerships.
- Phased rollout ensures a secure transition from multisig to full DAO
governance.

In short:
- Presale → Secure early $EYE + LP allocations.
- Staking → Boost yields + access priority.
- LP Vaults → Earn stable, asset-backed yield.
- DAO → Have a say in EcoYield’s future.

EcoYield combines these elements to create a transparent,
community-driven investment ecosystem where participation always links
back to real-world infrastructure.
