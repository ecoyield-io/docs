# Treasury Management

EcoYield’s treasury is the backbone of the protocol, ensuring sustainable growth, consistent yield distribution, and long-term alignment between investors, stakers, and the ecosystem. Every dollar that flows through the system is allocated with the dual goals of maximising investor returns and strengthening the $EYE token economy.

## 1. Buybacks

* A portion of performance fees (typically 50%) is used to buy back $EYE tokens directly from the market.
* These tokens are either redistributed into the staking rewards pool or burned, depending on DAO governance decisions.
* The mechanism reduces circulating supply, strengthens demand, and rewards committed long-term holders.

## 2. Emissions

* 10% of the total $EYE token supply is allocated to staking emissions.
* Emissions are linearly vested across 48 months, ensuring early adopters are rewarded with higher APRs while avoiding hyperinflation.
* Over time, emissions are gradually replaced by treasury-funded buybacks, meaning yield becomes entirely self-sustaining from real-world revenue.

## 3. Reinvestment

* EcoYield’s treasury reinvests part of the protocol revenue into new AI + renewable projects, creating compounding growth.
* Each new vault deployed increases total TVL (Total Value Locked), which drives more fees, more buybacks, and higher investor yield.
* This reinvestment cycle is what fuels the Real Yield Flywheel; TVL → Yield → $EYE demand → Growth → More vaults.

## Why This Matters for Investors

* Sustainability: Treasury-backed rewards prevent the “Ponzi tokenomics” problem common in DeFi.
* Alignment: Buybacks ensure that token holders benefit directly from project success.
* Growth: Reinvestment compounds TVL and AUM (Assets Under Management), increasing yield potential at scale.
* Governance Power: The DAO will eventually decide the exact split between buybacks, emissions, and reinvestment, making treasury strategy a core governance lever.
