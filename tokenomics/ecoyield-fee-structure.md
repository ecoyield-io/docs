# Fee Structure

EcoYield’s fee model is designed to make the protocol sustainable, align our success directly with investor success, and build a strong treasury for long-term growth. Unlike speculative projects, our fees are simple, transparent, and tied only to real project performance.

### 1. Funding (Structuring) Fee

Every project has legal and operational costs that must be covered before a single kilowatt-hour of energy is produced or a GPU goes online.

* Rate: 2.5 % (one-time).
* Who pays: The project developer, not the investors.
* When charged: Only once a project vault reaches its funding target.
* What it covers:
  * Legal structuring and contracts.
  * KYC/AML compliance checks.
  * Technical due diligence and audits.
  * Creation of the SPV (Special Purpose Vehicle) that ring-fences the project.
  * Integration with blockchain oracles and protocol security.

\
Think of this like a set-up fee: the project pays EcoYield for unlocking the capital that makes it possible to get funded. Investors keep their full contribution working for them.

### 2. Performance Fee

EcoYield only earns when projects are generating yield. The performance fee ensures our incentives are directly tied to investor returns.

* Base rate: 10 % of project yield (standard market return).
* Step-up rate: +0.5 % for every 1 % above the market benchmark (“hurdle rate”).
  * _Example:_ If benchmark is 12 % and a project delivers 20 %, EcoYield’s share is 14 %, leaving \~17 % net for investors.
* Where it goes:
  * 50 % → $EYE token buybacks (reduces supply, supports price, and strengthens staking rewards).
  * 50 % → Protocol treasury (funds future growth, covers reserves, and strengthens EcoYield’s balance sheet).

\
This means EcoYield only earns more when you earn more, our performance fee grows _in line_ with project success.

### 3. Feasibility Study Fee

Every project must be vetted before launch. These checks are carried out by independent engineering and financial firms, not EcoYield.

* Who pays: Project developers.
* What it covers: Technical feasibility, financial modelling, environmental and planning checks.
* Why excluded: Since this fee is paid to third-party specialists, it is not part of EcoYield’s revenue model.

\
This ensures that every project is technically sound and financially viable before investor capital is committed.

### 4. Withdrawal Fees

We believe in low friction.

* Rate: None.
* Why: Barriers to redemption create barriers to entry. By removing withdrawal fees, EcoYield makes it easy for investors to access their yield at any time.

\
This open-access approach builds trust and confidence for both retail and institutional investors.

### Why This Matters

EcoYield’s fee model has been designed to be fair, transparent, and growth-oriented:

* Investor aligned: We only make more when projects perform better.
* Transparent: Fees are predefined and easy to calculate.
* Sustainable: Treasury growth + $EYE buybacks compound long-term value.
* Accessible: No hidden charges or withdrawal penalties.

\
&#x20;In short, EcoYield is not a speculative “DeFi” project. We run like an infrastructure business: clear fees, transparent accounting, and upside tied to real-world performance.
