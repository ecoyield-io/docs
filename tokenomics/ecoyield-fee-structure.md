# Fee Structure

EcoYield’s fee model is designed to keep the protocol sustainable, align
incentives with investors, and ensure long-term treasury growth. Unlike
speculative projects, our fees are simple, transparent, and directly
linked to real project performance.

## 1. Funding (Structuring) Fee

- 2.5% one-off fee charged on every new project vault once it reaches
its funding target.
- Paid by the project developer, not investors.
- Covers essential costs such as legal setup, KYC/AML checks, technical
due diligence, SPV formation, and protocol integration.
- Ensures projects are properly structured before a single kilowatt-hour
of energy is produced.

## 2. Performance (Yield Skim) Fee

- A percentage of yield is taken from every cash flow generated by the
project.
- Base rate: ~10% of yield on market-standard projects.
- Step-up rate applies for higher-yield projects: the more successful
the project, the greater the protocol’s performance share.
- Fees are split evenly:
- 50% → $EYE token buybacks (supporting long-term value and staking
rewards).
- 50% → Protocol treasury (to fund growth, security, and reserves).

This model aligns EcoYield with investor success; the protocol only
earns more when projects outperform.

## 3. Feasibility Study Fee

- Separate from EcoYield.
- Paid directly to independent engineering and technical firms
conducting feasibility studies.
- Not included as protocol revenue.

## 4. Withdrawal Fees

- No withdrawal fees for investors.
- Users can redeem yield freely, ensuring open access without
unnecessary barriers.

## Why This Matters

- Investor aligned: The protocol only succeeds when investors
succeed.
- Transparent: All fees are predefined and simple to calculate.
- Sustainable: Fees grow treasury reserves and fund $EYE buybacks,
creating compounding value for long-term holders.
- Low friction: No withdrawal fees, ensuring accessibility and investor
confidence.

EcoYield generates revenue sustainably while keeping
investors protected and incentivised. Fees fuel growth, buybacks, and
treasury stability, ensuring the protocol’s longevity.
