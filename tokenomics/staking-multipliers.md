# Staking Multipliers

EcoYield’s staking model is designed to reward long-term commitment while keeping access to new projects open and fair.

It does two things at once:

1. Boosts yields for wallets that stake $EYE alongside LP tokens.
2. Controls access to early project raises through a two-stage system.

### Staking & Yield Boosts

When investors fund projects, they receive LP tokens (their share of the vault). By staking $EYE tokens in the same wallet, they can boost their yield and improve their access score.

#### Staking Multipliers

Locking $EYE for longer multiplies its effect on the score:

| Lock Period | Multiplier |
| ----------- | ---------- |
| 1 month     | ×1.0       |
| 3 months    | ×1.5       |
| 6 months    | ×2.5       |
| 12 months   | ×4.0       |

This ensures short-term stakers still benefit, but long-term lockers gain a bigger edge without creating runaway inflation.

### Two-Stage Access System

Every new project raise is split into two stages:

#### Stage 1: Core Pool (Priority Access)

* Reserved for existing LPs and $EYE stakers.
* Allocation is distributed pro-rata by Stake Score.
* Example: if you hold 10% of the total Stake Score, you’re entitled to 10% of the Stage-1 allocation.
* Any unused allocation rolls into Stage-2.

#### Stage 2: Public Pool (Open Access)

* Open to new LPs and the wider market.
* Allocations distributed pro-rata by cash contributed.
* Existing LPs/stakers can also participate here, but on equal terms with new entrants.

This ensures:

* Long-term backers get rewarded.
* New investors can always enter.
* The DAO can adjust the Stage-1 / Stage-2 split (e.g. 70/30, 50/50) depending on demand.
