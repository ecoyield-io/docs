# Presale Structure; Tiered Pricing & Scarcity Model

EcoYield’s presale is designed to reward early conviction, create
natural scarcity, and ensure that capital raised directly accelerates
the deployment of our first AI-compute + renewable energy projects.

## Tiered Token Pricing

- The $EYE presale follows a step-up pricing model, starting at
$0.015 and increasing incrementally across multiple phases until the
public presale, which opens at $0.025.
- Each tranche is capped, meaning once a tier sells out, the price
automatically increases for the next.
- This creates urgency and ensures early investors receive the lowest
entry price and the highest upside.

## Scarcity & Sell-Through

- The presale is structured as a 10-phase ladder, with limited
allocations at each tier.
- As tokens are sold, subsequent phases become more expensive,
incentivising early participation.
- This model is designed to drive momentum and ensure the raise
progresses in a predictable, transparent way.

## Use of Funds

- A significant portion of presale proceeds will be deployed directly
into real projects (GPU-powered compute farms and renewable energy
systems).
- This creates a direct link between presale participation and
real-world yield generation, setting EcoYield apart from purely
speculative token raises.

## Early Participant Benefits

- Early presale participants receive access to the lowest priced $EYE
tokens, with immediate upside locked in before public launch.
- Participation also positions wallets for priority access to EcoYield
vaults once live, where real-world yields are generated and
distributed.
- This structure makes the presale more than just a token purchase 
it’s an on-ramp into EcoYield’s real yield ecosystem.

⚡ In short: The EcoYield presale isn’t about hype; it’s about building
the first wave of projects, rewarding early conviction, and creating a
transparent, scarcity-driven path to scale.
