# LP Tokens; Yield-Bearing, Asset-Backed Vault Allocations

EcoYield LP (Liquidity Provider) tokens represent a share of real-world,
revenue-generating infrastructure. Unlike speculative DeFi tokens,
EcoYield LP tokens are directly backed by GPU compute farms, solar
arrays, and battery storage; making them a transparent and reliable
source of yield.

## 1. What LP Tokens Represent

- When an investor contributes capital into a project vault, they
receive LP tokens.
- These tokens track their proportional share of that project’s
cashflows.
- Backed by tangible infrastructure; not synthetic or inflationary
models.

## 2. How LP Tokens Generate Yield

- Cashflows come from GPU leasing (to AI firms, LLM developers,
decentralised networks) and renewable energy sales (via PPAs or reduced
OpEx).
- Yield is distributed pro-rata in stablecoins (e.g., USDC), targeting
25–35% APY depending on project IRRs.
- $EYE staking can boost LP token yields further, rewarding committed
participants.

## 3. Pre-Sale Investor Advantage

- Pre-sale investors will be among the first to receive LP tokens,
proportionate to their early contribution, once pilot projects are
deployed.
- This creates a direct link between early capital and yield-bearing
assets, adding tangible value to their $EYE token allocation.

## 4. Liquidity & Flexibility

- LP tokens are redeemable at project maturity.
- Future phases will introduce secondary LP markets, enabling
peer-to-peer trading and early exits.

## 5. Why LP Tokens Matter

- Transparency; On-chain reporting of project vault cashflows.
- Sustainability; Yields powered by real assets, not unsustainable
emissions.
- Scalability; As EcoYield expands globally, LP vaults multiply,
compounding total value locked (TVL) and protocol growth.

✨ The Result: LP tokens transform AI compute and renewable energy
infrastructure into digital, yield-bearing assets; giving investors
exposure to one of the fastest-growing industries, with stable,
transparent on-chain returns.
