# Yield Tokens

EcoYield Yield Tokens represent a share of real-world, revenue-generating infrastructure. Unlike speculative DeFi tokens, EcoYield Yield Tokens are directly backed by GPU compute farms, solar arrays, and battery storage; making them a transparent and reliable source of yield.



## 1. What Yield Tokens Represent

When an investor contributes capital into a project vault, they receive Yield Tokens. \
These tokens track their proportional share of that project’s cashflows.\
Backed by tangible infrastructure; not synthetic or inflationary models.

## 2. How Yield Tokens Generate Yield

Cashflows come from GPU leasing (to AI firms, LLM developers, decentralised networks) and renewable energy sales (via PPAs or reduced OpEx).\
Yield is distributed pro-rata in stablecoins (e.g., USDC), targeting 20–30% APY depending on project IRRs.\
$EYE staking can boost Yield Token returns further, rewarding committed participants.

## 3. Pre-Sale Investor Advantage

Pre-sale investors will be among the first to receive Yield Tokens, proportionate to their early contribution, once pilot projects are deployed.

This creates a direct link between early capital and yield-bearing assets, adding tangible value to their $EYE token allocation.

## 4. Liquidity & Flexibility

Yield Tokens are redeemable at project maturity.\
Future phases will introduce secondary markets, enabling peer-to-peer trading and early exits.

## 5. Why Yield Tokens Matter

Transparency; On-chain reporting of project vault cashflows.\
Sustainability; Yields powered by real assets, not unsustainable emissions.\
Scalability; As EcoYield expands globally, Yield vaults multiply, compounding total value locked (TVL) and protocol growth.\


Yield Tokens transform AI compute and renewable energy infrastructure into digital, yield-bearing assets; giving investors exposure to one of the fastest-growing industries, with stable, transparent on-chain returns.
