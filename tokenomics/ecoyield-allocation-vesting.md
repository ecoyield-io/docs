# Allocation & Vesting / Unlocking

EcoYield’s token distribution has been carefully designed to balance
growth, sustainability, and long-term alignment between the team,
investors, and community. Our model ensures no single group can dominate
supply, while providing confidence that tokens unlock gradually in line
with real project delivery.

## 1. Allocation Overview

\- Community & Presale Rounds — Majority of supply reserved for presale
participants and the wider community through public vaults.  
- Ecosystem Growth — Allocations for future partnerships, liquidity
initiatives, and ecosystem incentives.  
- Team & Advisors — Structured to align long-term, with multi-year
vesting and cliffs to ensure delivery focus.  
- Treasury & DAO Reserve — To support future governance, protocol
development, and buyback mechanisms.  
- Staking Rewards — Allocated for emissions, gradually tapering as
protocol buybacks and revenues sustain yields.

## 2. Vesting & Unlocking Principles

\- No Pump-and-Dump: Unlocks are intentionally staged to prevent early
dumping and protect long-term investors.  
- Cliffs for Team & Advisors: Tokens remain locked for an initial period
(cliff) before vesting linearly over multiple years.  
- Gradual Release for Investors: Private and public presale allocations
unlock progressively, ensuring alignment with project milestones.  
- Yield-First Approach: Unlocks are tied to protocol readiness and
project deployment, not hype cycles.

## 3. Example Unlocking Schedule (Illustrative)

\- Presale Rounds:  
• Small % at TGE (to create early liquidity).  
• Remaining vested linearly over 12–18 months.  
  
- Team & Advisors:  
• 12-month cliff.  
• Vesting monthly over 36 months thereafter.  
  
- Staking Rewards:  
• Linearly vested over 48 months, supplemented by protocol buybacks.  
  
- Treasury & DAO:  
• Released progressively in line with governance activation and DAO
treasury growth.

## 4. Why This Matters

EcoYield’s vesting design is built to:  
- Align incentives — Early backers share upside, but no group can
dominate supply.  
- Protect investors — Gradual releases mitigate short-term volatility.  
- Reinforce credibility — Vesting mirrors real infrastructure build-out,
not speculation.  
- Build trust — Investors know the project cannot “dump” supply;
everything is structured, predictable, and tied to project delivery.

✨ The takeaway: EcoYield’s allocation and vesting model ensures
fairness, stability, and alignment — keeping the protocol grounded in
real-world yield and long-term growth, not hype.
