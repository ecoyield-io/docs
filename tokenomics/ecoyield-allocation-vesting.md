### Why This Matters

* Long-Term Alignment: Vesting schedules for seed, team, and advisors prevent short-term flipping and keep everyone focused on long-term value.
* Early Scarcity Drives Demand: Only a portion of tokens are unlocked at TGE, creating supply pressure and upside for early participants.
* Sustainable Growth Engine: Staking, ecosystem, and Yield Token rewards are structured to fuel adoption, participation, and network effects.
* Built-In Flexibility: The reserve gives EcoYield the firepower to seize future strategic opportunities without diluting the tokenomics.
