# $EYE Token Utility

The $EYE token is the governance and incentive layer of EcoYield. Unlike speculative tokens, $EYE derives its value from real-world infrastructure, yield flows, and protocol growth. It is designed to reward long-term participants, align incentives, and ensure the sustainable expansion of EcoYield’s platform.

## 1. Governance Power

* $EYE holders gain voting rights within the EcoYield DAO.
* Vote on:
* Approval of new renewable AI compute vaults.
* Treasury strategies (buybacks, grants, reinvestment).
* Protocol upgrades and ecosystem partnerships.
* This turns EcoYield into a community-driven infrastructure platform, where investors help shape the future.

## 2. Yield Boosts (APY Multipliers)

* Locking $EYE tokens increases yield on LP vaults.
* Longer lock-ups = higher multipliers (e.g., 1.5× at 3 months, up to 4× at 12 months).
* This ensures alignment: capital providers (LP holders) and token holders both benefit.
* Boosted APY rewards incentivise long-term holding and reduce sell pressure.

## 3. Access Priority to New Vaults

* Staking $EYE not only boosts yield but also unlocks priority access to high-demand project vaults.
* Long-term stakers gain early allocation rights, creating natural demand for $EYE as EcoYield scales.
* This makes $EYE the “key” to the ecosystem, linking token ownership with first-choice access to future infrastructure projects.

## 4. Treasury Management

* 50% of performance fees are used for $EYE buybacks, driving constant demand.
* The bought-back tokens are redistributed to stakers, compounding rewards.
* As more projects are deployed, the buyback engine strengthens; making $EYE a deflationary, utility-driven asset.

## Why It Matters for you

$EYE is more than a speculative token. It is the gateway to governance, boosted yields, and privileged access. Together with LP tokens, it ensures that EcoYield scales as a transparent, yield-backed, and community-driven ecosystem.
