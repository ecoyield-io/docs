# Resources & Links

This section provides quick access to EcoYield’s core resources 
official channels, investor materials, and technical documentation. It
also highlights where our internal team needs to insert final links and
files as they are published.

## Official Channels

- Telegram Community → \[Insert invite link\]
- GitHub Repository → \[Insert repo link for smart contracts &
audits\]

- Investor Relations Contact → \[Insert team email / contact form
link\]

Action: Team to add the final URLs once each channel is launched.

## Investor Collateral

- Terms of Service → \[Insert final public version\]

Action: Confirm final compliance versions before publishing publicly.

## Data Room (Investor Access)

- Notion Investor Data Room → \[Insert secure access link once
available\]
Includes: Tokenomics, IRR models, project financials, legal docs.

Action: Investor access should remain gated; Gitbook can describe
contents but not expose confidential files.

Reminder for Team:
- Audit all links regularly (especially Google Docs/Sheets) for
permissions.
- Ensure public Gitbook only contains investor-facing materials.
- Keep private, confidential files gated via Notion or Data Room
invite-only links.
