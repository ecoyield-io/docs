# 🚀 Roadmap — Phase-by-Phase Timeline

EcoYield’s growth plan is designed to balance speed, execution
credibility, and investor confidence. Each phase builds on real
infrastructure deployment, growing TVL, and progressive decentralisation
through the EcoYield DAO.

## Phase 1 — Q3–Q4 2025: Foundation & Presale

\- Private Seed Round & Public Presale (10-phase tiered structure).  
- Investor incentives: early presale funds tied directly to pilot
project deployment, with LP allocations distributed upon project
go-live.  
- Token Generation Event (TGE) immediately after presale close → ensures
liquidity and market confidence.  
- First pilot project: Leeds, UK (10 GPUs + 150kW solar).  
- DAO multisig governance begins for core operations.

## Phase 2 — Q1–Q2 2026: Flagship Deployment (UAE)

\- Deploy Dubai flagship project: 100 GPUs, 800kW solar + 2MWh
battery.  
- Launch secondary markets for LP tokens → enabling liquidity and
structured exits.  
- Expand marketing flywheel (Coinpresso 3:1 ROAS + KOL partnerships) to
accelerate TVL growth.  
- \$EYE token live with staking + yield boost utility.

## Phase 3 — Q3–Q4 2026: Global Scaling & Institutional Onboarding

\- Rollout additional renewable-powered compute farms across the UK,
UAE, and new geographies.  
- Explore corporate partnerships with AI labs and decentralised GPU
networks (Render, Akash, Bittensor).  
- Carbon credit integration → projects generate certified credits for
additional revenue.  
- Pilot LP secondary trading module and insurance vaults under DAO
governance.

## Phase 4 — Q1–Q2 2027: DAO Expansion

\- Community DAO activation with transferable \$EYE governance.  
- Treasury oversight shifts from multisig to DAO treasury management.  
- Members gain proposal/voting rights on new vaults, treasury
allocation, and ecosystem partnerships.  
- Full transparency on protocol revenues, buybacks, and performance
fees.

## Phase 5 — Q3–Q4 2027: Full Decentralisation & Institutional Scale

\- EcoYield operates as a decentralised infrastructure investment
platform.  
- DAO governs all new vault approvals, treasury allocations, and
protocol upgrades.  
- Expanded portfolio of global compute + renewable projects under
management.  
- Target milestone: \$1bn+ AUM, positioning EcoYield as the first
“digital BlackRock” for tokenised clean energy + AI compute.

✨ EcoYield’s roadmap is simple but ambitious: build real yield
projects, compound TVL, and progressively decentralise into a global
DAO.
