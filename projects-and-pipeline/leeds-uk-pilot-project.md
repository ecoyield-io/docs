# Leeds, UK Pilot Project

## Overview

The Leeds pilot is EcoYield’s first data centre deployment: a modular AI compute facility combined with rooftop solar generation. It demonstrates our model of pairing renewable power with high-demand GPU leasing, while delivering attractive returns and measurable ESG impact.

## Project Specifications

* Location: Stanningley, Pudsey, Leeds, UK
* System Size: 150 kWp solar PV + containerised AI data centre (10 × NVIDIA H100 GPUs)
* Grid Connection: Approved, with planning permissions secured
* Solar Generation: \~187,264 kWh annually (first year)
* On-Site Consumption: \~24.2% of site’s electricity needs met by solar
* Carbon Savings: \~37.8 tonnes CO₂e avoided per year (equivalent to \~87 barrels of oil)

## Financials

* Funding Requirement: £400,000
* Gross IRR: 31%
* Projected Payback: \~3 years
* Estimated First-Year Electricity Savings: \~£35,190
* LCOE (Levelised Cost of Energy): \~£0.07 per kWh

## Timeline

* Funding Close → Q4 2025
* Deployment Start → 6 weeks post-funding
* Operational Date → Q1 2026

## Impact

* Establishes EcoYield’s first live proof of concept.
* Generates stable GPU leasing income + renewable energy revenue.
* Forms the foundation for scaling to larger projects in the UAE and beyond.
