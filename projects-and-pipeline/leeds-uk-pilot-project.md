# Leeds, UK Pilot Project

## Overview

The Leeds pilot is EcoYield’s first live deployment: a modular AI compute facility paired with a 150 kWp rooftop solar PV system. It showcases our hybrid model of renewable-powered GPU leasing, designed to generate strong investor returns while delivering measurable ESG benefits.

## Financials

* Funding Requirement: \~$407,000&#x20;
* Projected IRR (Gross): \~24.7%
* Projected Payback: \~5.1 years
* Estimated Year 1 GPU Revenue: $151,200 (based on $2.50/hr lease, 80% utilisation, 93% efficiency)
* Estimated Year 1 Electricity Savings: \~£35,190
* GPU OPEX: \~$15,898/year electricity + $7,250 O\&M + GPU replacements ($97k over cycle)

## Impact

* Establishes EcoYield’s first proof-of-concept hybrid facility in the UK.
* Generates dual revenues: GPU leasing (\~$2.5/hour, 80% utilisation) + renewable electricity.
* Demonstrates measurable ESG impact (≈ 37.8 tCO₂e savings/year).
* Provides a blueprint for scaling into larger projects in Dubai, the UAE, and other global markets&#x20;
