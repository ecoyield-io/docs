# Dubai UAE Flagship Project

The Dubai flagship project represents EcoYield’s largest pilot to date
and a critical step in scaling renewable-powered AI compute
infrastructure across the GCC. Strategically located in Bab Al Shams,
UAE, this deployment combines a state-of-the-art GPU compute farm with a
large-scale solar + battery storage system, creating one of the
highest-yielding projects in our early portfolio.

## Project Specifications

- GPUs: 100 × NVIDIA H100 (high-performance AI compute units).

- Solar Array: 800 kWp ground-mounted system (≈ 1,500 JA Solar JAM72 modules).

- Battery Storage: 2 MWh Huawei Luna2000 pack.

- Inverters: 3 × Sungrow SG350-HX (1.05 MWac total).

- Site: Bab Al Shams, UAE.

- Consumption Strategy: Hybrid model; 80% self-consumption by GPUs, 20% exported under long-term PPA agreements.

- Carbon Impact: ~25,000 tCO₂ emissions saved across system lifetime.

## Financials & Returns

- Funding Requirement: £3.38M.

- Gross IRR: 30.96% (Base case).

- Net IRR: 24.93% (after protocol fees).

- Payback Period: 2.56 years.

- NPV: £12.06M.

- Annual GPU Revenue (Yr 1): £1.13M, growing annually at ~6% GPU leasing index.

- Energy Export Revenue (Yr 1): £20k+.

- Cumulative Net Cashflow (25 yrs): £43.5M.

## Timeline

- Pre-Funding Stage: August 2025 – final technical, feasibility, and legal approvals secured.

- Deployment: 3–3.5 months post-funding.

- Operational Date: Targeting Q2 2026.

- GPU Replacement Cycles: Every 3 years, reinvested from project yield.

- Solar PPA Contract Length: 25 years.

## Investor Value

- High-Yield Dual Revenue: GPU leasing + solar export.

- Long-Term PPA Contracts: Securing stable clean-energy cashflows.

- Asset-Backed: Entire project ring-fenced in a UAE SPV, with assets fully collateralised.

- Scalability: Blueprint for larger GCC deployments (Saudi, Oman, Abu Dhabi).

- Environmental Impact: Integrates clean power, displaces fossil-fuel compute, and generates verifiable carbon credits.

✨ The Dubai flagship is designed as EcoYield’s showcase project 
pairing the world’s most in-demand compute with sustainable,
revenue-generating infrastructure in one of the fastest-growing AI hubs
globally.
