# Dubai UAE Flagship Project

## Overview

The Dubai flagship project represents EcoYield’s largest deployment to date and a critical step in scaling renewable-powered AI compute infrastructure across the GCC. Located in Bab Al Shams, UAE, this project combines a 100-GPU H100 compute farm with a 795 kWp ground-mounted solar array and 2.0 MWh Huawei Luna2000 battery storage, making it one of the highest-yielding and most technically advanced pilots in our early portfolio .

## Project Specifications

* GPUs: 100 × NVIDIA H100 PCIe (80 GB HBM2e, 350 W TDP).
* Solar Array: 795 kWp (≈ 1,500 JA Solar JAM72 modules).
* Battery Storage: 2.0 MWh Huawei Luna2000 pack (5 units in parallel, 8.4 MWh stored energy).
* Inverters: 3 × Sungrow SG350-HX (1,050 kWac total).
* Location: Bab Al Shams, UAE.
* Performance:
  * Annual Solar Generation: 1,508 MWh/year.
  * Specific Yield: 1,897 kWh/kWp/year.
  * Performance Ratio (PR): 80.94%.
  * Solar Fraction: 43.04% (portion of load met directly by solar).
* Consumption Strategy: Hybrid model; \~81% direct solar self-consumption with balance supplemented by grid, small surplus exports under PPA  .
* Carbon Impact: \~1,713 kgCO₂ avoided per kWp (\~25,000 tCO₂ lifetime reduction) .

## Financials & Returns

* Funding Requirement: $3.65M (£3.0M approx.) .
* Year 1 GPU Leasing Revenue: $1.296M (based on $2.50/hr, 80% utilisation).
* Year 1 Solar Export Revenue: \~$20k+.
* Gross IRR: \~30%&#x20;
* Payback Period: \~2.6 years.
* NPV (25 yrs): £12M+.
* Cumulative Net Cashflow (25 yrs): \~£43.5M  .

## Timeline

* Pre-Funding Stage: Completed August 2025, technical, feasibility, and legal approvals secured.
* Deployment: 3–4 months post-funding.
* Operational Date: Targeting Q2 2026.
* GPU Replacement Cycles: Every 3 years, reinvested from project yield.
* Solar PPA Contract Length: 25 years.

***

## Impact

* Dual Revenue Streams: GPU leasing + solar export.
* Long-Term Contracts: Stable, collateralised returns via a UAE SPV.
* Scalability: Blueprint for wider GCC roll-out (Saudi, Oman, Abu Dhabi).
* Environmental Benefit: Integration of renewables with AI compute, displacing fossil-fuel-powered compute and generating verifiable carbon credits.
