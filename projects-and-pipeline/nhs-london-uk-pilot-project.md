# NHS London, UK Pilot Project

## Overview

The NHS pilot is EcoYield’s first EV charging deployment: a network of ROLEC Quantum charging pedestals installed on an NHS estate. It demonstrates our model of pairing reliable, grant-eligible infrastructure with revenue-sharing that directly benefits the NHS. The project supports the UK’s clean transport goals, provides staff and visitors with access to charging.
