# Pilot Project IRRs

EcoYield’s pilot projects provide the first proof points for our yield model, combining AI compute + renewable energy infrastructure. Each project has been fully modelled with feasibility studies, IRR projections, and deployment timelines.



## **NHS London, UK; Deployment Ready EV Charging Station - NHS UK**

* IRR: 27%
* Deployment: 15x 7kW AC EV chargers Funding Requirement: £33,000.
* Status: NHS site secured, electrical load assessment complete, infrastructure design finalised. Ready to deploy within 8–10 weeks post-funding.
* Revenue Drivers: EV charging tariffs (staff + public), 20% revenue share with NHS Trust
* Purpose: Proves the EcoYield model in a high-visibility NHS setting + high yield for token holders.

## Leeds, UK; AI Compute + Solar (Pilot Site)

* IRR (Gross): 31%
* Deployment: 10 GPU modular compute units + 150kW rooftop solar.
* Funding Requirement: £400,000.
* Status: Land secured, planning permission and grid connection in place, ready to deploy in 6 weeks post-funding.
* Revenue Drivers: GPU leasing contracts, excess energy sales to the grid.
* Purpose: Demonstrates the EcoYield model in a controlled UK market, creating the first vault for LP investors.

## Dubai, UAE; AI Compute + Solar + Battery Storage (Flagship Project)

* IRR (Gross): 27%
* Deployment: 100 GPU modular compute units + 800kW solar farm + 2MWh battery energy storage system (BESS).
* Funding Requirement: £3.25M.
* Status: Site identified, feasibility studies completed, 18-week deployment timeline.
* Revenue Drivers: GPU wholesale leasing, long-term solar PPA agreements, energy storage arbitrage.
* Purpose: Larger-scale flagship project that validates global scalability and stronger yields from combining compute + renewables in the GCC.

### Why This Matters

* Leeds proves the concept at small scale, with low capex and quick deployment.
* Dubai scales the model significantly, delivering higher IRR and positioning EcoYield for global replication.
* Together, these pilots underpin the real-world, yield-backed foundation of the EcoYield ecosystem.
