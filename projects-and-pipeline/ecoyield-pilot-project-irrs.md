# Pilot Project IRRs

EcoYield’s pilot projects provide the first proof points for our yield model, combining AI compute + renewable energy infrastructure. Each project has been fully modelled with feasibility studies, IRR projections, and deployment timelines.



## **NHS London, UK; Deployment Ready EV Charging Station - NHS UK**

* IRR (Gross): \~38%
* Deployment: 15x 7kW AC EV chargers Funding Requirement: $44,297
* Status: NHS site secured, electrical load assessment complete, infrastructure design finalised. Ready to deploy within 8–10 weeks post-funding.
* Revenue Drivers: EV charging tariffs (staff + public), 20% revenue share with NHS Trust
* Purpose: Proves the EcoYield model in a high-visibility NHS setting + high yield for token holders.

## Leeds, UK; AI Compute + Solar (Pilot Site)

* IRR (Gross): \~25%
* Deployment: 10 GPU modular compute units + 150kW rooftop solar.
* Funding Requirement: $407,000
* Status: Land secured, planning permission and grid connection in place, ready to deploy in 6 weeks post-funding.
* Revenue Drivers: GPU leasing contracts, excess energy sales to the grid.
* Purpose: Demonstrates the EcoYield model in a controlled UK market, creating the first vault for Yield Token investors.

## Dubai, UAE; AI Compute + Solar + Battery Storage (Flagship Project)

* IRR (Gross): \~30%&#x20;
* Deployment: 100 × NVIDIA H100 GPUs + 795 kWp ground-mounted solar farm + 2.0 MWh Huawei BESS.
* Funding Requirement: $3.65M&#x20;
* Status: Site secured in Bab Al Shams; feasibility, structural, and legal studies completed. \~16–18 week deployment timeline.
* Revenue Drivers: GPU wholesale leasing ($1.3M+ annual Yr 1), solar PPA exports, and storage optimisation.
* Purpose: EcoYield’s largest pilot to date, designed to validate global scalability and showcase stronger yields from pairing compute with renewables across the GCC.

### Why This Matters

* NHS London proves the EcoYield model in a high-visibility NHS setting, combining clean transport impact with measurable community benefit
* Leeds proves the concept at small scale, with low capex and quick deployment.
* Dubai scales the model significantly, delivering higher IRR and positioning EcoYield for global replication.
* Together, these pilots underpin the real-world, yield-backed foundation of the EcoYield ecosystem.
