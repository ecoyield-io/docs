# Privacy Policy â€” Data Handling

At EcoYield, we take data privacy seriously. Our approach is designed to
protect investors, partners, and community members while meeting
international compliance standards.

## 1. Data Collection

\- We only collect the minimum data necessary to operate the platform,
comply with regulations, and deliver services.  
- This includes KYC/AML verification (for LP token investors), basic
contact information, and transaction records related to vault
participation.

## 2. Data Usage

\- Collected information is used strictly for:  
â€¢ Identity verification and compliance (KYC/AML).  
â€¢ Secure processing of investments and vault allocations.  
â€¢ Communication regarding project updates, governance, and support.  
  
We do not sell or monetise personal data.

## 3. Data Storage & Security

\- All sensitive data is stored securely, with encryption and restricted
access.  
- Records are maintained in compliance with international data
protection frameworks (including GDPR where applicable).  
- Access to personal data is limited to authorised staff and trusted
compliance partners (e.g. KYC providers such as Sumsub).

## 4. Data Sharing

\- Data may be shared with:  
â€¢ Regulatory authorities where required by law.  
â€¢ Independent auditors and compliance partners.  
â€¢ SPVs/foundations within the EcoYield group where necessary for
investment operations.  
  
We ensure that all third parties meet strict security and
confidentiality standards.

## 5. User Rights

\- Investors may request access, correction, or deletion of their
personal data in line with applicable laws.

British Virgin Islands (BVI), where our legal entities are
established.

international investor participation.
