# Compliance & Legal Overview

EcoYield operates under a multi-jurisdictional legal framework designed to ensure that all capital inflows, token sales, and project-vault operations comply with applicable securities, commodities, and digital-asset regulations.

Our structure separates the on-chain protocol layer from the off-chain asset layer, creating a compliant bridge between Web 3 liquidity and real-world energy and AI infrastructure.

## 1. Token Issuance & Investor Framework

EcoYield’s token ecosystem is built around two instruments:\
• $EYE Token: a utility and governance token providing staking rewards, access to vaults, and participation in DAO governance.\
• Yield Tokens (LP Tokens): issued to investors representing their proportional participation in specific project vaults and the underlying revenue streams.

Private Offering Structure\
• Non-U.S. Investors: Tokens are issued under a SAFT (Non-U.S.) framework compliant with Regulation S.\
• U.S. Accredited Investors: Tokens are offered under a SAFT (U.S.) framework compliant with Reg D Rule 506(c).\
• Vault Participants: Subscription agreements are governed by the Limited Partnership Subscription Agreement (LPSA) and the relevant project SPV terms.

All investors must complete full KYC/AML verification before participation.\
Retail participation is gated through jurisdictional compliance checks at the on-ramp stage.

## 2. Jurisdiction & Entity Structure

EcoYield’s operational and legal architecture is designed for transparency and scalability:

| Project SPVs / Vaults    | EcoYield Project Holdings Ltd & EcoYield Project Vault 1 (BVI) _Sequential company formations in BVI_ | Own and operate real-world renewable + compute assets    |
