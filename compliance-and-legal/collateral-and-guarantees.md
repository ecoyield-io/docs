# Collateral & Guarantees

How EcoYield protects investor capital through legal structuring,
asset-backing, and risk controls.

EcoYield is designed to ensure that investor funds are always tied to
real-world assets and protected by robust legal frameworks. Unlike
speculative protocols, every vault is underpinned by tangible
infrastructure; solar farms, battery storage systems, and GPU data
centres; held in Special Purpose Vehicles (SPVs) to ring-fence risk and
guarantee transparency.

## 1. SPV Ownership & Asset-Backed Security

- Each project (e.g., Leeds Pilot, Dubai Flagship) is owned through a
dedicated SPV.
- Investor funds flow into these SPVs, which directly hold the project
assets (land lease, solar panels, batteries, GPUs).
- This ensures clear asset ownership, cashflow traceability, and
separation from the parent company’s balance sheet.
- In the unlikely case of corporate distress, the underlying project
remains protected and ring-fenced.

## 2. Collateralisation & Guarantees

- All deployments are backed by real infrastructure contracts
(planning, grid, PPAs, GPU leases).
- Revenues (energy sales, GPU leasing) are pledged to the vaults first,
before protocol profits.
- Where possible, insurance and performance guarantees are layered in to
mitigate force majeure, counterparty default, or technical failures.
- Legal docs (Terms of Service, Risk Disclosure Statements, Privacy
Policies) define the risk perimeter transparently for all participants.

## 3. Investor Protection Measures

- Funding Fee (2.5%) ensures legal, compliance, and KYC/AML costs are
covered upfront before any project goes live.
- Performance/Yield Fees only scale with project success; EcoYield
earns more only when LPs earn more.
- No withdrawal fees: investors can exit yields without punitive
penalties, ensuring flexibility.
- Privacy & compliance safeguards: EcoYield operates under Panama
Foundation, BVI SPV, and UAE HQ to comply with MiCA-aligned frameworks
while protecting investor data.

## 4. Why This Matters

This design ensures that EcoYield is not a “trust-me” DeFi model but a
legally enforceable, asset-backed investment structure.
- Investors know exactly where their money is going.
- Assets are tied to long-term contracts with predictable returns.
- Risks are disclosed transparently (see Risk Disclosure Statement).
- Protocol incentives are aligned with investor success; creating real
yield, not vaporware.

In summary: EcoYield collateralises every vault with real projects,
safeguards capital through SPVs and legal protections, and aligns
protocol rewards with investor returns; ensuring confidence,
compliance, and credibility at scale.
