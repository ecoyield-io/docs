# Collateral & Guarantees

EcoYield is designed to ensure that investor funds are always tied to real-world assets and protected by robust legal frameworks. Unlike speculative protocols, every vault is underpinned by tangible infrastructure—solar farms, battery storage systems, and GPU data centres—held in Special Purpose Vehicles (SPVs) to ring-fence risk and guarantee transparency.

### Asset-Backed Security Structure

**SPV Ownership & Ring-Fencing**

* Each project (e.g., NHS London, Leeds Pilot, Dubai Flagship) is owned through a dedicated Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV)
* Investor capital flows into the SPV, which directly owns the land lease, solar panels, batteries, GPUs, and revenue contracts
* This ensures clear asset ownership, cashflow traceability, and separation from the parent company's balance sheet
* In the unlikely case of corporate distress, the underlying project remains protected and ring-fenced

**Real Asset Collateralisation**

* Every Yield Token is backed by real-world infrastructure: GPU hardware, solar arrays, and battery systems
* Yield Tokens entitle holders to yield generated from GPU leasing contracts and clean energy sales
* All deployments are backed by real infrastructure contracts including planning permissions, grid connections, PPAs, and GPU leases
* On-chain proof ensures all vaults and project flows are transparent and auditable via smart contracts

### Risk Mitigation & Guarantees

**Revenue Protection**

* Revenues from energy sales and GPU leasing are pledged to the vaults first, before protocol profits
* Insurance and performance guarantees are layered in where possible to mitigate force majeure, counterparty default, or technical failures
* Pre-vetted projects undergo independent feasibility studies before fundraising begins

**Operational Safeguards**

* Multi-sig treasury secures funds in controlled wallets until deployment milestones are met
* DAO oversight will mature to include governance votes on new vault approvals and treasury allocations
* Legal documentation (Terms of Service, Risk Disclosure Statements, Privacy Policies) transparently define the risk perimeter for all participants

### Investor Protection Measures

**Aligned Fee Structure**

* Funding Fee (2.5%) covers legal, compliance, and KYC/AML costs upfront before any project goes live
* Performance/Yield Fees only scale with project success—EcoYield earns more only when LPs earn more
* No withdrawal fees: investors can exit yields without punitive penalties, ensuring flexibility

**Regulatory Compliance**

* EcoYield operates under Panama Foundation, BVI SPV, and UAE HQ to comply with MiCA-aligned frameworks while protecting investor data
* Privacy and compliance safeguards ensure regulatory adherence across jurisdictions

### Why This Structure Matters

This design ensures that EcoYield is not a "trust-me" DeFi model but a legally enforceable, asset-backed investment structure where:

* **Capital is never free-floating**—it is collateralised by tangible assets with clear ownership
* **Yield comes from real activity**—compute and energy sales, not speculation or token emissions
* **Projects are de-risked**—via feasibility studies, independent audits, and transparent on-chain reporting
* **Investors have full visibility**—knowing exactly where their money is going and what assets back their returns
* **Protocol incentives are aligned**—creating real yield through productive infrastructure, not vaporware
