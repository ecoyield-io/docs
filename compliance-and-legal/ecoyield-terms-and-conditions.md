# Terms & Conditions

Participation in EcoYield requires an understanding of both the opportunities and the risks involved. These terms outline the basic rules that govern investor interaction with our platform.

## 1. Eligibility

* Participants must be at least 18 years old.
* Investors must complete KYC/AML verification before receiving Yield Token allocations.
* EcoYield is not available to residents of jurisdictions where participation would breach local laws (including restricted territories under sanctions).

## 2. Nature of Investments

* Investments are structured via Yield Tokens, which represent allocations in project vaults backed by renewable powered GPU infrastructure.
* The $EYE token provides governance rights, staking boosts, and access priority but is not a security.
* All investments carry inherent risks, including market volatility, regulatory changes, and project-specific risks.

## 3. Investor Responsibilities

* Investors are solely responsible for ensuring that their participation complies with local laws and regulations.
* Participation requires use of secure wallets (e.g., hardware wallets) to safeguard tokens.
* EcoYield is not liable for losses due to private key mismanagement, third-party hacks, or user error.

## 4. Fees

* A 2.5% structuring fee is charged on each new project vault.
* A performance fee (10–20%) is deducted from project yields, split between the EcoYield treasury and $EYE buybacks.
* No withdrawal fees apply.

## 5. Risk Disclosures

Participation involves financial risk. Investors should be aware:

* Yields are based on real-world project performance and are not guaranteed.
* Token prices may fluctuate significantly.
* Regulatory frameworks for tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) are still evolving and may impact EcoYield’s operations.
* In extreme circumstances (e.g., force majeure, grid outages, project failures), yields may be delayed or reduced.

## 6. Governance & Disputes

* Governance decisions are made through the EcoYield DAO once fully active.
* Until then, operational control sits with the EcoYield Foundation (Panama) and BVI SPVs.
* Any disputes will be subject to the laws of the jurisdiction in which the relevant entity operates.

Important Notice: By participating in EcoYield, investors confirm that they understand and accept the risks outlined above. Investments in tokenized infrastructure should be considered high-risk and only undertaken with capital that participants can afford to lose.
