## User Account

### Account Registration

Users may register for an account by selecting the “Join Waitlist” or “Sign Up” option, which will direct you to an onboarding interface requiring the submission of your basic information, including full name, email address, country of residence, and connection of a compatible Web3 wallet. Know Your Customer (“KYC”) and Anti-Money Laundering (“AML”) verification procedures are not required during the initial registration process and shall only be initiated at the point of token purchase or engagement in staking activities involving fiat or Cryptocurrency. By completing the registration process or connecting a wallet, you expressly acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agreed to be bound by the Platform’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.

### Third-Party Representation

Each user must register their own Account. We do not allow third parties, including legal representatives, to register an Account on someone else’s behalf. By accepting these Terms, you confirm that the registration is made personally by you, for your own use. Any attempt to create an Account through a third party is strictly prohibited and may result in the suspension or termination of the Account. Users are solely responsible for their own registration and use of the Services under these Terms.

### Account of Minors

EcoYield does not allow registration and opening of accounts for minors.

### Limitation on Multiple Accounts

By accepting these Terms, you confirm that you are registering an Account for your own use and on your behalf. Each user, whether a natural person or a legal entity, is permitted to create and operate only one Account. EcoYield ensures that users maintain a single account by cross-checking their email and phone number during the KYC process and through third-party verification agents. If multiple or duplicate account registrations are detected, the platform will decline the user’s verification to uphold account integrity.

### Account Closure

Where access to the Platform is authenticated through a connected digital wallet, we do not store your private keys nor do we exercise custody over your Wallet. If you have voluntarily submitted additional off-chain data, such as your email address, contact information, or platform preferences, such data may be deleted upon request by contacting us via support on the Platform. Following verification of Wallet ownership, the requested data will be deleted within thirty (30) days.

To initiate account closure, you may submit a request via User’s dashboard or by contacting support. Upon request, instructions for transferring any remaining funds such as USDC or ETH to your connected Wallet, will be provided via the dashboard or email. Upon successful deletion of the account, you will receive a confirmation email notifying you of the permanent removal of your account and associated off-chain data from our systems.

Please be advised that all on-chain data (including wallet addresses and associated blockchain activity) is immutably recorded on distributed ledgers and cannot be deleted or modified by the Platform.

### Account Suspension and Termination

We retain the right to suspend, restrict, or terminate your access to our Services at our sole discretion under various circumstances, including but not limited to the following:

1. We have reasons to believe that your actions may harm our reputation or have resulted in adverse consequences for EcoYield;
2. We are legally obligated to do so by a regulatory authority, court order, law enforcement request, or any other competent authority;
3. There are reasonable grounds to suspect a breach of these Terms or any other applicable agreement;
4. We suspect unauthorized or fraudulent access to your Account, or believe that login into your Account has been initiated without your consent or knowledge, or suspect any other compromise in the security of your Account;
5. There are reasonable grounds to believe that a Transaction or an Order is erroneous;
6. There are reasonable grounds to suspect money laundering, terrorist financing, fraud, or other financial crimes associated with your Account, or your Account is believed to be non-compliant with the applicable laws and regulations and associated with heightened risks regarding regulatory norms and requirements;
7. Your Account is subject to ongoing or pending litigation, investigations, or legal proceedings; and/or
8. Your Account has been involved in any Prohibited Use activities and/or Prohibited Businesses as outlined in these Terms;

In the event of suspension or termination of Services, whether temporarily or permanently, your access to the Services or any part thereof will be ceased without notice and with immediate effect. We reserve the right not to provide you with any reasons for the suspension, restriction, or termination of your access to the Services. You agree and acknowledge that we may not disclose specific reasons for suspension or termination of your access based on internal confidential criteria aimed at maintaining security and complying with relevant legal requirements related to risk mitigation and prevention of illicit activities and financial crime, and that any and all criteria pertaining to the decision-making on modification, restriction, suspension, and termination of your access to our Website, and/or Services will not be disclosed to you or any unauthorized third parties under any circumstances, except in cases required by applicable law or judicial decision.

We retain the right to share any information submitted to us with competent authorities to ensure compliance with the anti-money laundering and terrorist financing laws and regulations and other relevant legal requirements. This action may be taken if we have substantial grounds to believe that your Account is associated with fraudulent activities, money laundering, terrorism financing, or other financial crimes. Additionally, should we be unable to conclusively ascertain a User’s affiliation with any of the aforementioned illicit activities, we may disclose such information to competent authorities for their evaluation.

## KYC/AML Verification

### KYC/AML Verification Process

KYC/AML Verification is a procedure conducted by us to assess the background and eligibility of our customers for opening an account in accordance with the requirements and provisions of the Law of Virgin Islands on Anti-Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing Code of Practice (“AML/CTF Act”). We ensure that KYC/AML Verification procedures are conducted for all users registering an Account in strict adherence to the due diligence measures prescribed by the AML/CTF Act.

The KYC/AML Verification process is an essential component of our commitment to ensuring a secure and compliant environment for our Users. As part of this process, we collect and process certain personal information to fulfil our legal obligations and enhance the security of our Services. We undertake the collection and processing of personal information in strict accordance with our own Privacy Policy. It is crucial that you review and familiarize yourself with our Privacy Policy to understand how your personal data is collected, used, and protected within our ecosystem.

### Third Party Services

By providing the information requested during the KYC/AML Verification Process, you hereby authorize us to conduct full AML and KYC verification as referenced in these Terms.

We utilize services provided by the third-party provider Sumsub, operated by Sum and Substance Ltd with its registered address at 30 St. Mary Axe, London, England, EC3A 8BF for certain aspects of the verification process.

To verify the identity of users during account opening, EcoYield implements the following procedures:

1. Users are prompted to undergo a KYC process, which includes uploading identification documents. National identification documents, including identity card, passports, and driver's licenses are accepted as valid means of verification.
2. Users must also complete proof of address verification, which may require submitting identification documents such as utility bills, bank statements, lease agreements, proof of rent payment, or a residence certificate.
3. Further verification steps may include biometric authentication.

### Data Accuracy

By providing us with the information required for identity verification and KYC/AML Verification, you affirm that all the information you submit is true, accurate, and complete. You also confirm that you have not intentionally concealed or manipulated any information to influence the outcome of our assessment. If any submitted information is found to be false, inaccurate, or incomplete, you agree to promptly correct these inadequacies by providing additional documents and records to rectify the aforementioned omissions.

### Notification of Changes

In the event of any changes in circumstances that affect the accuracy and integrity of the information you provided, you are obligated to promptly inform us of such changes and provide up-to-date information accordingly.

### Disclosure to Authorities

We retain the right to share any information submitted to us with competent authorities as per the AML/CTF Act and other relevant legal requirements. This action may be taken if we have substantial grounds to believe that the provided information is associated with fraudulent activities, money laundering, terrorism financing, or other financial crimes. Additionally, should we be unable to conclusively ascertain a User's affiliation with any of the aforementioned illicit activities, we may disclose such information to competent authorities for their evaluation.

## Wallet

EcoYield Wallet (the “Wallet”) is a non-custodial software tool that enables you to store supported digital assets and delegate the Platform’s native token, the $EYE (“Token”). As a non-custodial Wallet, you retain sole control over your Token and bear full responsibility for all actions taken in connection with your Wallet, including transactions to and from the Wallet and the safekeeping of your private keys.

Private and public keys are generated securely using cryptographic algorithms within your browser or device, depending on the type of wallet you use such as MetaMask or WalletConnect. The platform does not generate, access, or store your private keys at any time. You are solely responsible for managing and safeguarding these keys, as they are required to authorize transactions on the Network.

### Wallet Risk Disclaimer

You agree and acknowledge that your use of our Wallet should be limited in regards to the specific virtual asset supported by the Wallet. We shall not be liable for any attempt or event to store any unsupported Virtual Currency in your Wallet, deliberately or accidentally, and consequences arising from an act thereof.

You further acknowledge that the secure disposal and storage of your private and public keys is your sole responsibility. You must ensure the availability of a backup of all your data in regards to the Wallet, including but not limited to Wallet credentials, passphrases, identifiers, public and private keys, and Network addresses. We shall not be responsible nor liable for storing the said data and shall not be responsible for providing you a copy of the said data in the event of deliberate or accidental deletion, disposal, or loss of the data in question. You further understand that failure to store a backup of data in question may result in an inability to access and/or use your Wallet and Token stored in it, including in the event of discontinuation or termination of certain Services.

Completion of any transaction is performed by recording a transaction in a relevant decentralized ledger, therefore confirming it in a Network. Please note that blockchain Networks are decentralized and peer-to-peer in nature. Therefore, we are not responsible for any confirmation of any transaction in regards to the Token, as we exercise no control over the Network it is native to. You further acknowledge that your transactions may be delayed, or not be completed, in connection with the above-mentioned reasons. In addition, you acknowledge that for the same reasons, your transaction with the Token may not be reversed, cancelled, or modified once it has been placed.

The above-mentioned disclaimer of risk and reasons thereof apply to a similar extent to any event of a fork or other Network disruption. You understand that any such event, including forks, may lead to interruptions, delays, and partial or incorrect completions of transactions involving the Token, for which we shall assume no liability.

### Retrieval of Keys and Credentials

You are solely responsible for the secure storage and handling of your Wallet credentials, including passwords, private keys, recovery phrases (seed phrases), and Network addresses. If you are using a self-custodial wallet such as MetaMask or WalletConnect, your Wallet can be recovered only by correctly entering your 12- or 24-word recovery phrase into a compatible wallet application.

We do not store, manage, or retrieve any private keys, recovery phrases, or Wallet access data. If your recovery phrase is lost, forgotten, or compromised, access to your Wallet and any associated funds may become permanently inaccessible. You acknowledge and accept that it is your sole responsibility to ensure secure storage and confidentiality of your recovery phrase.

We recommend that you regularly review and update your personal security practices to safeguard your access credentials and prevent unauthorized access. You must exercise due caution when handling and inputting recovery phrases, as their misuse or exposure may result in irreversible loss of access to your Wallet and digital assets.

All account data within the EcoYield ecosystem is generated based on the private key and remains immutable once created. Therefore, in the event of key loss or compromise, EcoYield emphasizes that it cannot intervene or rectify the situation. Users are solely responsible for the protection and retention of their private keys. By engaging with the Services and creating the Wallet, you understand and acknowledge that there is no mechanism for altering the private key post-compromise, as all account-related data is connected to the original private key.

Nevertheless, in the event of private key compromise or loss, users are advised to take immediate action by creating a new account and transferring all of the Token to the newly generated account.

### EcoYield Token Ownership

Any Tokens that you hold in your Wallet are your property. By no means shall we access and use any Tokens held in your Wallet for the purposes of transferring the ownership, loaning the said funds to you and third parties, claiming interests over the said funds on our or third parties’ behalf, etc.

As an owner of the Token in your Wallet, you acknowledge the risks associated with buying and selling the Token. We shall not be liable for any losses as well as fluctuations in rates and value of the Token deposited into your Wallet.

## Trading

The following section sets forth the conditions under which the Users may start trading on the Platform.

Only specific cryptocurrencies are supported for trading via our Platform. You may see the list of currently supported cryptocurrencies on our Website at \[link].

Please note that completion of any transaction is performed by recording a transaction in a relevant centralized ledger, therefore confirming it in a network. Blockchain networks are decentralized and peer-to-peer in nature; therefore, we are not responsible for any confirmation of any transaction in regards to any cryptocurrency transaction performed via our Services, as we exercise no control over any cryptocurrency network. You further acknowledge that your transactions may be delayed, or not be completed, in connection with the above-mentioned reasons. In addition, you acknowledge that for the same reasons, your cryptocurrency transactions may not be reversed, cancelled, or modified once it has been placed.

The above-mentioned disclaimer of risks applies to a similar extent to any event of a fork or other disruption of the respective cryptocurrency network. You understand that any such event, including forks, may lead to interruptions, delays, and partial or incorrect completions of cryptocurrency transactions, for which we shall assume no liability.

**By placing a trading order (“Order”), you agree that we reserve the right to cancel, terminate, or otherwise refuse the processing of any Cryptocurrency transaction in accordance with law or lawful order of any law enforcement authority or court. Any Order or transaction deemed to be associated with acts of money laundering, financing terrorism, committing fraud or other financial crimes will never be processed by EcoYield and appropriate action will be taken as prescribed by law, should such transaction be identified.**

### Order Placement

To start trading on the Platform, you must first create a registered account, complete the required KYC/AML verification process, and connect a supported wallet or deposit funds into your account. Once these steps are completed, follow the instructions below to begin placing and executing orders on the Exchange:

1. Log into your Account using your registered email and password. You can also login through the self-custodial wallet authentication.
2. Navigate to the trading interface, where a searchable dropdown list or market pair selector is available. You can choose from supported trading pairs such as EYE/USDC, ETH/USDC, or BTC/ETH.
3. Complete the order form by selecting the market pair, entering the amount you wish to buy or sell, and choosing the order type.
4. Click on the **Buy** button to place a Buy Order or **Sell** button to place a Sell Order. The Platform will confirm your action with a notification and update the order status accordingly.
5. You will be able to monitor and track all placed orders through the "Order" section on the navigation bar.

### Order Execution

EcoYield provides users with the option to place the following types of Orders:

* Market Orders, or orders executed at the prevailing market price.
* Limit Orders, or orders executed at a specified price or better.

#### Market Orders

Market Orders are orders placed to buy or sell Crypto Currency at the prevailing market price. Market Orders are executed immediately upon placement, subject to cryptocurrency liquidity and available order book depth. As Market Orders are executed at the best available price in the market at the time of execution, the execution price of Market Orders may vary from the quoted price displayed at the time of order placement on the Exchange.

Unlike Limit Orders, Market Orders do not have a specified price limit. Therefore, users accept that Market Orders may be executed at prices different from the last quoted price. Users understand that due to market fluctuations, the executed price of Market Orders may differ from the last quoted price, particularly during periods of high volatility or low liquidity. While we try to ensure that Market Orders are executed in their entirety, you understand that execution may be partial if there is insufficient liquidity available in the market.

Market Orders are valid only at the time of placement and may not be modified or canceled once submitted.

#### Limit Orders

Limit Orders are orders placed to buy or sell Crypto Currency at a specified price or better. Limit Orders are executed only when the market price reaches the specified limit price or better. If the market price does not reach the specified limit price, the Order remains pending until it can be executed at the desired price. As such:

* Sell Limit Orders are executed when the last market price is equal to or greater than the specified limit price.
* Buy Limit Orders are executed when the last market price is equal to or greater than the specified limit price.

You acknowledge that Limit Orders may not be executed immediately upon placement. The execution of Limit Orders is contingent upon the market reaching the specified limit price. As such, by placing a Limit Order, you understand that Limit Orders may be partially executed if the market reaches the specified limit price but there is insufficient liquidity to fill the entire Order quantity.

Limit Orders remain valid for the duration specified by you in the Order details or until executed, canceled, or expired. You have the option to modify or cancel Limit Orders before they are executed.

### Order Fulfilment

In the event of an unsuccessful attempt to fulfil your Order, we will promptly notify you via an in-platform message, in-app alerts or email, specifying the reasons behind the failure and seeking your consent to resubmit and re-fulfil the Order based on the current exchange rate.

You agree and acknowledge that in cases where Order execution is hindered due to factors beyond our control, including low liquidity, price changes and other conditions outside our direct influence, we cannot be held liable for any failures or delays in Order fulfilment.

In addition, please note that all Orders are executed on a prepaid basis, meaning that you must ensure the sufficient amount of funds in your Account to fulfil an Order. The funds required to execute an Order are set aside until the Order is fulfilled, cancelled, expires, or is terminated. The total funds necessary for placing an Order encompass both the Order's value and any applicable fees. Please note that any Order requiring an amount exceeding the available funds in your Account will not be executed and will be declined.

In cases where Order execution fails due to **external technical failures** beyond our control (such as node desynchronization, provider downtime, or interrupted price feeds), Orders may be temporarily suspended or fail entirely. Such instances will be clearly marked in the user’s **Order History** with a corresponding status (e.g., "Failed" or "Cancelled").

We shall not be held liable for delays or failure to fulfill Orders where such failures are caused by market conditions or technical constraints outside of our direct control.

### Order Matching and Execution

The Exchange facilitates Order matching and execution by pairing buy (bid) and sell (ask) Orders based on price priority and, where prices are equal, time priority.

#### Matching of Market Orders

In the case of Market Orders, execution is prioritized based on price and time. When a Market Order is submitted to the Exchange, it is matched immediately with the best available opposite Order in the order book. There is no waiting for a match with another Order; instead, the placed Market Order is matched with the existing Limit Orders in the order book at the best available prices.

* If a Buy Market Order is placed, it will match with the lowest available ask price (the price at which sellers are willing to sell) in the order book.
* If a Sell Market Order is placed, it will match with the highest available bid price (the price at which buyers are willing to buy) in the order book.

Please note that Market Orders can potentially impact the market price, especially for cryptocurrencies with lower liquidity or thinner order books. The immediate execution nature of Market Orders means that they may be filled at prices slightly different from the last traded price or from the displayed bid-ask spread. You acknowledge that Market Orders do not guarantee a specific price of execution and that the actual price at which the order is filled may differ from the last traded price or the displayed bid-ask spread, especially in fast-moving cryptocurrency markets.

#### Matching of Limit Orders

In the case of Limit Orders, users specify the exact price at which they are willing to buy or sell a given cryptocurrency. A Buy Limit Order indicates the highest price the user is willing to pay, while a Sell Limit Order reflects the lowest price the user is willing to accept.

The Platform maintains an active order book that lists all open Limit Orders, organized by price and then by the time of submission. Orders are prioritized first by price, and among orders at the same price level, the one placed earlier will be executed first. This structure ensures fair and transparent order matching.

A Limit Order is executed only when the market price meets the user’s specified limit price.

* A Buy Limit Order will be matched with a Sell Limit Order that is at or below the specified price. The Order will be filled at the lowest available ask price.
* A Sell Limit Order will be matched with a Buy Limit Order that is at or above the specified price. The order will be filled at the highest available bid price.

The actual trade is executed at the most favorable price available within the specified range. If there is insufficient volume to completely fulfill a Limit Order at the desired price, the Order may be partially filled. The unfilled portion will remain active in the order book until it is either matched, cancelled by the user, or expired in accordance with the Platform’s policies.

Limit Orders provide users with greater control over execution prices, and they help minimize market impact by waiting for suitable prices rather than triggering immediate execution. However, they do not guarantee immediate fulfillment and may remain unexecuted in volatile market conditions where prices change rapidly.

To ensure fairness, the Exchange matches Limit Orders at the same price based strictly on the time of placement. This time-priority rule promotes transparency and equitable access for all users participating on the Platform.

### Order Confirmation

Upon execution, users will receive confirmation of the executed price and quantity of the Order as soon as the trade is completed. You can see the confirmation by navigating to the **Order/Trades History** page on the Website.

The Order confirmation includes information such as the Order ID, type of Order, amount, price, execution status, timestamp, as well as our contact information in case you have further questions, inquiries or complaints about the Order.

Please be aware that the timeframes in which the Platform generates Order confirmations are non-binding, indicative and may vary based on network conditions and other factors. In no event shall we be liable for any delays in confirming your Orders as well as failures to adhere to or otherwise ensure the aforementioned confirmation speed.

### Compliance-Related Non-Fulfilment

If an Order cannot be fulfilled due to compliance reasons, we retain the right to delay its fulfilment until compliance clearance is obtained. Such an Order will undergo further review within a reasonable timeframe. In the event that we are unable to clear an Order due to insufficient information or other pertinent reasons related to KYC or compliance requirements, we may request additional details concerning your identity, transaction nature, and other essential compliance-related information.

Orders failing to meet the relevant compliance requirements, particularly, when necessary, information has not been provided, will not be fulfilled under any circumstances. We may decline such Orders based on reasonable grounds of non-compliance with relevant requirements and legislation.

### Order Placement Through API

Users are currently permitted to place Orders on the Platform through API connections. To access API functionalities, Users may be required to enable API access through their Account dashboard and agree to specific API Terms of Use. For higher-volume or elevated-risk access, additional KYC/AML verification requirements may apply.

The Platform supports the placement of both Market Orders and Limit Orders via the API. Depending on the user’s account tier and system configuration, advanced order types may also be available.

The API is designed to be language-agnostic and is compatible with most programming languages and frameworks. While no additional fees apply for using the API, all standard trading fees remain applicable.

To ensure fair use, the Platform enforces an API rate limit. Exceeding the permitted rate may result in temporary suspension or blocking of access. Users are encouraged to monitor their request activity to remain within the prescribed thresholds.

Order execution through the API is designed to be fast and efficient, although execution timing may depend on market conditions, liquidity availability, and backend load. During high-traffic periods, minor latency may be experienced. Upon execution, Users will receive confirmation responses via the API itself and may also receive email or in-app notifications as applicable. Users have full flexibility to customize parameters such as price limits, stop loss conditions, order duration and other trade settings when placing Orders through the API.

Comprehensive API documentation, including authentication steps, endpoint specifications, order construction examples, error codes, and usage limits, is made available to all authorized Users. Technical support for API-related queries is available via email, ticketing system, and, where applicable, through dedicated developer support channels (Discord or Telegram). Higher-tier clients may be assigned direct technical liaisons for expedited assistance.

Users will be informed of any updates or changes to API functionality at least fourteen (14) calendar days in advance via email notifications, platform alerts, and updates in the developer documentation. Additionally, a sandbox (test) environment is available for users to safely test and validate API integrations prior to deployment in live trading conditions.

## Deposits

Please note that we shall not be liable for any error, failure, delay, and/or reliability issues associated with third-party service providers used for deposits. Prior to depositing funds into your Account, you must review and agree to the policies and compliance requirements of any external service provider involved in the deposit process.

At present, our platform accepts cryptocurrency deposits only, specifically USDC, ETH, and MATIC. Users may deposit cryptocurrencies directly via supported crypto wallets. Deposits involving fiat currencies may be facilitated in the future via third-party partners, subject to their availability and regulatory compliance.

Please be advised that only supported tokens are accepted. Unsupported or unverified tokens sent to the Platform may not be recoverable. All fiat onramps must be fully compliant with relevant legislation and regulatory frameworks.

For deposits, the processing time may vary depending on the number of confirmations required to confirm the deposit. Please note that any delay or interruption in regards to the speed, maintenance, and operational state of any network lies outside of our control and we shall not be liable for any disruption or delay thereof.

## Withdrawals

Withdrawal of funds can be made via crypto transfers, which will be sent to verified external wallets provided by the user. It is the user’s responsibility to ensure that the wallet address is accurate and capable of receiving the specified cryptocurrency. Transactions in cryptocurrencies are generally irreversible; errors in wallet address submissions may result in permanent loss of funds.

Withdrawals are subject to platform-defined limits based on user levels. These limits may apply on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis. As a general threshold, withdrawals are capped at $10,000 per day or 50,000 USDC per month, unless otherwise specified in the user’s account tier.

You understand that the withdrawal of funds may be affected by events such as state holidays, weekends, the internal processes of your financial institutions as well as other relevant factors. In no event shall we be liable for any delays in processing your withdrawals as well as failures to adhere to or otherwise ensure the aforementioned confirmation speed as EcoYield is not responsible for any such processing.

**For security reasons, you shall ensure the accuracy of the recipient wallet address when initiating a withdrawal. Please note that transactions in Crypto Currencies may be irreversible, and sending Crypto Currencies to the wrong address may result in the unrecoverable loss of funds. As an owner of the deposited Cryptocurrency funds, you acknowledge the aforementioned risks associated with withdrawing Crypto Currencies (for more information on risks associated with Cryptocurrency transactions, please see Risk Disclaimer section of these Terms).**

## Fees

Unless expressly communicated by EcoYield in connection with the announcement or any other form of communication to Users, you are required to pay any and all transaction fees (“Fees”) associated with your use of the Services at the time of any such use as reflected on the Website. Users should factor in these Fees when engaging in transactions and delegations within the EcoYield ecosystem. By using the EcoYield and its services, users implicitly agree to abide by the Fees outlined herein, including, but not limited to:

(a) **Blockchain Gas Fees** – These are Network-determined fees required to execute transactions on the blockchain. The amount may vary based on Network congestion and is not controlled by EcoYield.

(b) **Protocol Fees** – A fee ranging between two percent (2%) and five percent (5%) may be applied on staking vault returns. These fees are allocated towards the DAO treasury, token buybacks, and ongoing platform operations.

(c) **Early Unstaking Fees** – Fees may be imposed if you choose to exit a staking vault prior to the completion of the agreed lock-up period.

(d) **Third-Party Service Fees** – Where fiat on-ramps or third-party payment providers (such as credit card or bank transfer gateways) are used, additional service fees may apply. These fees are determined by the third-party provider and will be clearly disclosed at the time of transaction.

While the Fees specified under limb (a) of this Section are flat and determined by the Network itself (“Network fees”), it is crucial to recognize that fees reflected under limb (b) are percentage based. EcoYield does not impose platform fees for cryptocurrency deposits, and only Network gas fees apply. Withdrawals are likewise subject only to standard gas fees unless processed through a third-party fiat partner, in which case external fees may be applicable.

While we try to ensure that information about the Fees provided in these Terms as well as on the Website remains accurate and up-to-date, the actual Fees paid by you in connection with your use of our Services and interaction with the blockchain may vary from the information and estimates reflected in these Terms as well as on our Website. By engaging with our Services, you agree that you have made yourself informed about the dynamic nature of Network Fees and exercise due diligence in understanding the associated costs of their transactions within the EcoYield ecosystem by appropriate means that may include reviewing and verifying all Network Fees at the time of the execution of the transaction or after its execution through the open blockchain explorer accessible on the Website and familiarizing yourself with the volume and structure of the percentage-based Fees on the Website.
