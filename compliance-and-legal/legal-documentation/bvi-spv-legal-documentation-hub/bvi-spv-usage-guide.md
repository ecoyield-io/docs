The policy also addresses how DPA-covered users can exercise these rights by contacting you via your official communication channels, and how you may deal with such requests. <br><strong>Remark 2:</strong><br>In accordance with Article 61 of the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation and relevant ESMA guidance, please note that personal data of EU/EEA individuals under the General Data Protection Regulation will not be processed by you. If potential users are EU/EEA residents, you will be unable to offer your services to such individuals unless they have independently sought you out without any prior engagement, marketing, or solicitation from you.<br><br><strong>Remark 3:</strong><br>You may adjust the retention periods according to real-life practice. However, these data retention periods should still be in line with the principle of data retention under BVI’s law, which means that they should not be too long or excessive (e.g. 10 years) and should serve the purpose for which the data under each category is collected.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
