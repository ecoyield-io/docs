## Definitions

The following section covers the basic definitions used in this Privacy Policy. It describes what is meant by your personal data and who controls and processes your personal data.

This includes details like names, addresses, email addresses, identification numbers, and even things like IP addresses or cookie identifiers, as well as any information found online that may reveal your physical, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity.

**Data Subject:** The data subject is the person who the personal data is about, or their representative. In simpler terms, it is you or any other individual whose personal information is being collected and processed.

**Data Controller:** The data controller is the one who determines the purposes and means of processing personal data. In other words, they're the boss when it comes to deciding why and how your data is used. In this case, it would be us.

**Data Processor:** The data processor, on the other hand, processes personal data on behalf of the data controller. In our case, they are vendors and partners we collaborate with that process your personal data for purposes determined by us.

**GDPR- covered user**: GDPR-covered user refers to the individuals whose personal data is subject to the protections and regulations set forth by the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). GDPR is the regulation in European Union (EU) law that focuses on data protection and privacy for individuals within the EU and the European Economic Area (EEA). In compliance with the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) guidelines under the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCAR) as at April 2025, we do not accept clients from these jurisdictions unless they have independently sought our services without any prior engagement, marketing, or solicitation from us.

## Information of the Data Controller

We consider the security of your personal information to be of paramount importance. We employ a range of technical, organizational, and administrative measures designed to safeguard your data against unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. These security measures include:

* **Data encryption,** for which we use SSL encryption protocols to protect data during transmission and storage. This ensures that your information remains confidential and secure.
* **Role-based access controls,** or making sure that your personal information is restricted to authorized personnel, partners and employees who require access for specific purposes. When these purposes are fulfilled, and the person no longer needs your data to perform their responsibilities, we may revoke access to your personal information to avoid its use for illegitimate purposes or purposes not related to the provision of services to you. Access controls and authentication mechanisms are implemented to verify and restrict access.
* **Employee training,** which ensures that our staff is trained in matters related to data security and that they handle your information with care and adhere to the terms of this Privacy Policy and all the relevant data protection laws and regulations.
* **Data backups**, which we perform to prevent data loss in case of unexpected events or system failures. In addition to that, we have established incident response procedures to promptly address and mitigate any security incidents or breaches, should they occur.
* **The nature of blockchain technology itself,** which inherently provides transparency, immutability, and decentralization. In other words, your transactional and personal data is stored securely across multiple nodes, reducing the risk of unauthorized alterations or data breaches.
* **Conducting regular audits and updates** to identify and mitigate potential vulnerabilities or weaknesses in the Website’s and the Platform's infrastructure.
* **Data minimization,** which means that we collect and store only the minimum amount of personal information necessary to facilitate your transactions and provide our Services. Unnecessary data is not retained, reducing the potential impact of any security incidents.
* **User education,** meaning that we actively provide resources and guidance to educate you about the nature of our Services and blockchain technology in general, blockchain security best practices, and the responsible management of private keys and cryptocurrency assets. In the long term, this self-awareness helps you understand and protect your data.

If you ever have concerns about the security of your data, suspect any unauthorized activity, or would like to know the specific measures undertaken to secure your personal data, please don't hesitate to contact us via email at [support@ecoyield.io](mailto:support@ecoyield.io).

## Data Retention

Your personal information is held and stored securely for the duration of your active account with us. We are committed to retaining your personal information only for the **period necessary** to fulfill the specific purposes for which it was collected. Retention periods may vary depending on the type of personal data, but will not be processed for more than 10 years after the original purpose of collection has been achieved, unless there are specific requirements stipulating otherwise for certain data. After this period, your personal data will only be retained if it has been anonymized.

If you request to delete your account and there is no history of participation in our Services, we will promptly remove your email address from our records. However, if your account contains history, we may retain your email address for archive purposes and to comply with applicable laws and regulations, including anti-money laundering policies. In addition, user data is **anonymized after 12 months of inactivity**, and **non-essential information is systematically purged during quarterly data reviews** to ensure ongoing compliance with our data minimization practices and to enhance user privacy.

## Your Rights as Data Subject

As a User of our Services, you have certain rights regarding the personal data that we collect and use. These rights are designed to provide you with control and transparency over your data. The following are your rights as a data subject; you hold the discretion to claim them as long as this does not affect any third-party rights:

* **Right to Access:** You have the right to request access to the personal data we hold about you. This includes the right to obtain confirmation of whether we are processing your personal data and, if so, access to specific details of that processing.
* **Right to Rectification:** If you believe that the personal data we hold about you is inaccurate or incomplete, you have the right to request the correction or completion of such data.
* **Right to Erasure (Right to Be Forgotten):** You have the right to request the deletion of your personal data under certain circumstances. This right is not absolute and may be subject to legal requirements or legitimate interests that override your request.
* **Right to Prevent Processing for Direct Marketing:** You have the right to request that we stop processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. This right may be exercised at any time, and upon receiving your request, we will cease using your data for such marketing activities.

### Exercising Your Rights

To exercise any of the rights outlined above, or if you have any questions or concerns regarding the processing of your personal data, please contact us via our official communication channels. Our designated personnel will assist you with data-related inquiries and ensure that your rights as a data subject are respected.

Upon receiving a written request from you for access to your personal data, we will inform you in writing within thirty (30) days whether access to all or part of the personal data will be granted, in accordance with the applicable provisions of the DPA. If access is granted, we will provide the requested personal data upon payment of the prescribed fee, if applicable. However, we reserve the right to refuse access to personal data on any of the grounds permitted under Section 16 of the DPA.

We may extend the time limit for compliance with a request for access to personal data to an additional thirty (30) days if:

* meeting the original time limit would unreasonably interfere with the operations of the public body or private body; or
* consultations are necessary to comply with the request that cannot reasonably be completed within the original time limit; or
* by such a period of time as is reasonable, if the additional time is necessary for converting the personal data into an alternative format.

We do not ordinarily charge a fee for processing such requests. However, if a request is manifestly unfounded or excessive, we reserve the right to charge a reasonable fee based on the administrative cost of compliance. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with such a request and will provide a written explanation for our decision in such circumstances.

If the request contains insufficient information or is erroneous, we may request additional details from the data subject. If such additional information is not provided within the timeframe specified under applicable law, the request will be deemed not to have been made.

In addition to the means of exercising your rights outlined above, you have the right to lodge a complaint about our practices with the competent authorities of the country where you reside:

* If you reside in the British Virgin Islands, your data protection authority is the [Office of the Information Commissioner](https://www.bvi.gov.vg/support-contacts).
* If you reside in the EEA or Switzerland, you have the right to lodge a complaint with the data protection authority of your country.
