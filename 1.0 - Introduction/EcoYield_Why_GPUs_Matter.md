# Why GPUs Matter — The Engine of the AI Revolution

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is reshaping the world — from ChatGPT and
self-driving cars to drug discovery and climate modelling. But behind
every AI breakthrough lies a critical bottleneck: Graphics Processing
Units (GPUs).

Unlike standard computer chips (CPUs), GPUs are specialised processors
built to handle massive amounts of data in parallel. That makes them the
perfect tool for training and running large language models (LLMs),
generative AI, and advanced machine learning systems.

## In today’s market:

• Big Tech controls the supply. Google, Microsoft, Meta, and OpenAI are
racing to lock up GPU supply for their own mega data centres.

• Demand far outstrips supply. NVIDIA’s H100 chips are backordered for
months, with single units selling for \$30k–\$40k.

• AI adoption is exploding. The global GPU market for AI is forecast to
grow 10× this decade.

For investors, this creates a once-in-a-generation opportunity: access
to one of the most valuable and scarce resources in the digital economy.

EcoYield makes this opportunity accessible. Instead of being locked out
of GPU ownership, our community funds renewable-powered GPU farms. These
GPUs are then leased to:

• AI developers and LLM labs.

• Enterprise teams building AI solutions.

• Decentralised compute networks (e.g., Render, Akash, Bittensor).

Every contract generates real yield — paid back to our vault investors
in stablecoins.

And by combining GPUs with solar and battery systems, EcoYield delivers
this yield sustainably — reducing carbon intensity while tapping into
the strongest growth trend of the decade.

✨ In short: GPUs are the new “picks and shovels” of the AI gold rush.
EcoYield gives investors a direct, asset-backed way to participate —
with every dollar tied to tangible infrastructure powering the future of
AI.
