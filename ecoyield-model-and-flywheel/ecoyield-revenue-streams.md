# Revenue Streams

EcoYield generates sustainable, real-world income through four core revenue streams. These underpin the yields distributed to LP token holders and the long-term value of the $EYE ecosystem.

## 1. GPU Leasing (Primary Revenue)

* EcoYield deploys modular GPU farms powered by renewable energy.
* These GPUs are leased to:
* AI companies and LLM developers.
* Enterprise AI teams.
* Decentralised GPU marketplaces (e.g. Render, Akash, Bittensor).
* Leasing contracts create stable, high-demand cashflow, driving the protocol’s target yields of 25–35% APY.

## 2. Renewable Energy Sales (Secondary Revenue)

* Solar and battery infrastructure powers the GPU farms.
* Excess clean energy is either:
* Used to reduce operating costs (cutting OpEx).
* Sold back to the grid under long-term Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs).
* This creates an additional, low-risk revenue stream tied to long-term contracts.

## 3. Carbon Credits (Sustainability-Linked Revenue)

* EcoYield’s renewable projects generate certified carbon credits.
* These credits can be:
  * Monetised by selling to corporates with net-zero obligations.
  * Retired within the ecosystem to boost ESG credentials.
  * Carbon credits add a third cashflow channel while reinforcing EcoYield’s climate-positive mission.

## 4. Protocol Fees (EcoYield Treasury Revenue)

* EcoYield charges fees that ensure the protocol itself remains sustainable and scalable:
* Funding Fee (2.5%) → one-off structuring fee on every new project vault, covering legal, KYC/AML, and setup costs.
* Performance Fee (10–20%) → skimmed from project yield; split between the EcoYield treasury and $EYE token buybacks.
* No Withdrawal Fees → ensuring easy redemption while keeping barriers to entry low.

## Why This Matters for Investors

* Diversified income: AI compute + clean energy + carbon credits + protocol-level fees.
* Aligned incentives: Treasury performance fees and carbon monetisation fund $EYE buybacks and staking rewards.
* Real cashflows: Unlike speculative projects, EcoYield’s revenues are tied to hard assets, contracts, and infrastructure.

The result: Investors benefit from reliable yield today, while EcoYield builds a self-sustaining, climate-positive revenue engine for the long term.
