# The Real Yield Flywheel

EcoYield is designed as a self-reinforcing growth engine. Every new
vault, project, and participant strengthens the ecosystem, creating a
cycle of compounding demand and value.

## How the Flywheel Works

1. TVL Growth (Capital Inflows)
- New investors commit stablecoins into EcoYield vaults.
- Total Value Locked (TVL) rises, giving the protocol more deployment
capital.

2. More Yield
- Capital is deployed into GPU leasing + renewable energy projects.
- Projects generate sustainable cashflow, producing 25–35% APY for LP
token holders.

3. Stronger Track Record
- Each project adds to EcoYield’s real-world credibility and performance
history.
- Transparency + verified returns build investor trust.

4. $EYE Token Demand
- Investors buy and lock $EYE to boost yield and gain governance
rights.
- This creates scarcity and utility for the token.

5. Easier to Sell Out Future Vaults
- Proven track record and stronger community demand make each new vault
quicker to fund.
- More capital flows in → cycle repeats at a larger scale.

## The Compounding Loop

More TVL → More Yield → Stronger Brand + Trust → Higher $EYE Demand →
Faster Vault Sellouts → More TVL.

This compounding scalability loop ensures that EcoYield doesn’t rely on
hype or speculation. Instead, it grows through real assets, real
cashflows, and real investor returns.

In essence: EcoYield’s flywheel turns every project funded into
momentum for the next; building a long-term, self-sustaining growth
engine.
