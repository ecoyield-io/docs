# The Real Yield Flywheel

EcoYield is designed as a self-reinforcing growth engine. Every new vault, project, and participant strengthens the ecosystem, creating a cycle of compounding demand and value.

## How the Flywheel Works

1. TVL Growth (Capital Inflows)
   1. New investors commit stablecoins into EcoYield vaults.
   2. Total Value Locked (TVL) rises, giving the protocol more deployment capital.
2. More Yield
   1. Capital is deployed into GPU leasing + renewable energy projects.
   2. Projects generate sustainable cashflow, producing 25–35% APY for LP token holders.
3. Stronger Brand
   1. Each project adds to EcoYield’s real-world credibility and performance history.
   2. Transparency + verified returns build investor trust.
4. $EYE Token Demand
   1. Investors buy and lock $EYE to boost yield and gain governance rights.
   2. This creates scarcity and utility for the token.
5. Easier to Sell Out Future Vaults
   1. Proven track record and stronger community demand make each new vault quicker to fund.
   2. More capital flows in → cycle repeats at a larger scale.

## The Compounding Loop

More TVL → More Yield&#x20;

More Yield → Stronger Brand + Trust

Stronger Brand + Trust → Higher $EYE Demand&#x20;

Higher $EYE Demand → Faster Vault Sellouts →

Faster Vault Sellouts → More TVL.

This compounding scalability loop ensures that EcoYield doesn’t rely on hype or speculation. Instead, it grows through real assets, real cashflows, and real investor returns.
