# Yield Generation and Sharing

EcoYield vaults are the engine that convert real-world revenues (yield) into on-chain investor returns. Every vault is tied to a _real project_, such as GPU leasing or renewable energy generation, and produces stable cashflows that flow back to investors.

### 1. GPU Leasing (Primary Yield Source)

* EcoYield deploys modular GPU farms equipped with high-performance hardware (e.g. NVIDIA H100s)
* These GPUs are leased to:
  * AI model developers and LLM teams
  * Enterprise AI workloads
  * Decentralised GPU marketplaces (such as Render, Akash, Bittensor)
* Leasing contracts generate predictable, high-demand cashflow, which flows back to EcoYield LP vaults
* Target returns from GPU leasing are \~25–35% APY, creating the foundation for EcoYield's yield model

### 2. Clean Energy Revenue (Secondary Yield Source)

* Each compute farm is powered by renewable solar + battery infrastructure designed for efficiency and scalability
* Clean energy is monetised in two ways:
  * Offsetting compute OpEx, reducing costs and improving net yield
  * Selling excess power back to the grid through long-term Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs)
* This provides a low-risk, stable income stream tied to regulated energy markets

## How Yield Flows to Investors

The revenue distribution process follows a transparent, three-step mechanism:

### 1. Yield is Generated

Projects earn revenue from leasing GPUs to AI clients and selling power from renewable sources (solar, hydro, battery storage).

### 2. Fees are Applied

A small portion of project revenues goes to cover structuring and performance fees. These fees are split evenly:

* **50% → Treasury**: Used for stability, future growth, and reinvestment, strengthening the protocol's Total Value Locked (TVL)
* **50% → $EYE Buybacks**: Used to repurchase and burn tokens, reducing supply and increasing scarcity

### 3. Investor Returns

The remaining yield flows to investors based on their participation:

* **LP token holders** receive their share of net project yield (after fees) in stablecoins
* **$EYE stakers** unlock boosted rewards, including:
  * Stablecoins from project yield
  * Additional $EYE from buyback distributions
  * $EYE staking emissions

### Why This Matters

**Performance-Aligned Fees**: EcoYield only earns more when projects perform better than the benchmark. Fees scale with project yield, ensuring complete alignment with investor interests.

**Dual Reinforcement**: Half of fees grow the treasury, strengthening the protocol's balance sheet. The other half buy back $EYE on the open market, reducing supply and enhancing long-term token value.

**Investor Choice**: Every LP automatically earns project yield in stablecoins. By staking $EYE, investors can compound their returns further and gain governance rights over future vaults.
