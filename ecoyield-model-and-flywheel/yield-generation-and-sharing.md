# Yield Generation and Sharing

EcoYield vaults are the engine that convert real-world revenues (yield) into on-chain investor returns. Every vault is tied to a _real project_, such as GPU leasing or renewable energy generation, and produces stable cashflows that flow back to investors.

### 1. Yield is Generated&#x20;

• Projects earn revenue from leasing GPUs to AI clients and selling power from renewable sources (solar, hydro, battery storage).&#x20;

### 2. Fees are Applied&#x20;

• A small portion of project revenues goes to cover structuring and performance fees.&#x20;

• These fees are split evenly:&#x20;

• 50% → Treasury (used for stability, future growth, and reinvestment).&#x20;

• 50% → $EYE Buybacks (reducing supply, creating scarcity, and supporting token value).&#x20;

### 3. Investor Returns&#x20;

• LP token holders receive their share of net project yield (after fees) in stablecoins.&#x20;

• Investors who also stake $EYE unlock boosted rewards, including stablecoins, $EYE buybacks, and additional staking emissions.

### Why This Matters&#x20;

• Performance-Aligned Fees EcoYield only earns more when projects perform better than the benchmark. Fees scale with project yield, ensuring alignment with investors.&#x20;

• Dual Reinforcement Half of fees grow the treasury, strengthening the protocol’s balance sheet. The other half buy back $EYE on the open market, reducing supply and enhancing long-term token value.&#x20;

• Choice for Investors Every LP automatically earns project yield in stablecoins. By staking $EYE, investors can compound their returns further and gain governance rights over future vaults.
