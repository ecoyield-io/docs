# Environmental Impact

EcoYield is built on the belief that AI infrastructure must be powered
sustainably. By combining high-performance compute with renewable
energy, EcoYield ensures that every watt of GPU power deployed
contributes positively to the planet rather than adding to the carbon
problem.

## 1. Renewable-Powered Compute

- All EcoYield GPU farms are powered by solar + battery energy storage
systems.
- This ensures that AI compute demand is met without relying on fossil
fuels.
- Renewable generation reduces operational costs while also guaranteeing
a low-carbon footprint per teraflop of compute power.

## 2. Carbon Credits & Offsetting

- Surplus renewable energy contributes to certified carbon credits.
- EcoYield is exploring integrations with leading carbon markets to
ensure credits are verified and tradable.
- These credits can be used to offset emissions or sold to corporates
seeking to meet net-zero commitments.

## 3. ESG Integration

- EcoYield is designed as an ESG-compliant investment platform,
aligning with institutional sustainability frameworks.
- Governance through the $EYE DAO ensures that environmental
considerations remain core to decision-making.
- Impact metrics; such as tonnes of CO₂ offset and clean kWh generated
 will be tracked and transparently reported to investors.

## Why This Matters

- AI growth without fossil lock-in: EcoYield provides the compute
capacity AI needs without replicating the carbon-heavy mistakes of
traditional data centres.
- Measurable sustainability: Investors don’t just earn yield, they
contribute to tangible climate-positive outcomes.
- Institutional alignment: ESG frameworks are increasingly mandatory for
funds; EcoYield ensures compliance while delivering strong returns.

EcoYield proves that the future of AI can be green, profitable, and
sustainable; with investors directly funding the transition.
