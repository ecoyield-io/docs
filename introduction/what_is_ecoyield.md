# What is EcoYield?

EcoYield is a next-generation real-world asset (RWA) investment platform that fuses AI compute, renewable energy, and blockchain tokenisation to create transparent, sustainable yield.

At its core, EcoYield builds modular, renewable-powered data centres that host high-performance GPU hardware (such as NVIDIA H100s). These GPUs are leased to AI companies, enterprise teams, and decentralised compute networks; tapping into one of the fastest-growing markets in the world.

## How Investors Benefit

* Investors commit stablecoins into project vaults.
* In return, they receive LP Tokens (backed by real infrastructure) and $EYE Tokens (governance + yield boosting)
* Yield is generated from two streams:
  * GPU leasing revenue; from AI developers and networks.
  * Clean energy revenue; from solar + battery systems powering the sites, or sold to the grid via long-term PPAs.

This creates stable, asset-backed returns in the range of 25â€“35% APY, fully auditable and distributed on-chain.

## Why It Matters

* For Investors: Access to institutional-grade returns previously locked away by hyperscalers and funds.
* For AI: Scalable, sustainable GPU infrastructure to meet surging demand.
* For the Planet: A cleaner, decentralised model of AI compute powered by renewable energy.

## In One Sentence

EcoYield is the bridge between Web3 capital and real-world infrastructure, enabling anyone to invest in the future of AI and energy while earning sustainable, transparent yield.
