# Why Now?

The world is at the intersection of three unstoppable megatrends:

## 1. AI Compute Demand

- Global demand for GPUs is surging, with forecasts showing a 10×
increase by 2030.
- Major players like Google, Meta, and OpenAI are building vast data
centres, yet capacity remains scarce.
- GPU leasing prices are climbing rapidly, creating a
once-in-a-generation opportunity for infrastructure providers.

## 2. Renewable Energy Transition

- AI data centres require enormous, stable power; yet most still rely
on fossil fuels.
- The global shift toward decarbonisation and ESG mandates is driving
record investment into renewables.
- By combining AI compute with solar + battery systems, EcoYield
delivers lower-cost, sustainable power while helping meet climate goals.

## 3. Tokenisation of Real-World Assets (RWAs)

- Tokenised RWAs are projected to become a $16 trillion market by
2030.
- Most DeFi projects still rely on speculative yields with little
substance behind them.
- EcoYield bridges the gap by delivering auditable, tokenised exposure
to physical infrastructure, turning real cashflows into on-chain yield.

## Why EcoYield is Positioned to Win

At the convergence of AI, Renewables, and Tokenisation, EcoYield sits at
the centre of three global shifts:

- AI is exploding → GPU demand is outpacing supply.
- Energy must be clean → fossil-fuel compute is unsustainable.
- Finance is going on-chain → RWAs are becoming the new backbone of
DeFi.

By combining all three, EcoYield offers investors a rare timing
advantage: the chance to enter early into an emerging asset class,
backed by tangible projects and global megatrends that will define the
next decade.

This is why now is the moment; EcoYield transforms today’s
convergence into tomorrow’s opportunity.
