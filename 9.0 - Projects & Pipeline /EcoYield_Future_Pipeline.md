# Future Pipeline — Scaling to \$1B AUM by 2030

EcoYield’s long-term growth strategy is built on replicating our proven
model — modular, renewable-powered AI compute sites — across multiple
geographies. With a robust foundation in the UK and UAE, our pipeline
extends into high-demand regions across Europe and the GCC, targeting
over \$1 billion in assets under management (AUM) by 2030.

## Regional Expansion

• United Kingdom  
Expansion beyond the Leeds pilot, with additional GPU + solar projects
targeting enterprise AI demand and grid-connected PPAs.  
  
• European Union  
Select sites in energy-stable markets with strong renewable incentives
(Germany, Netherlands, Nordics). Focus on modular GPU farms co-located
with renewable generation to meet the EU’s sustainability targets.  
  
• GCC (UAE, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Oman)  
Large-scale deployments leveraging abundant solar resource, stable
regulatory frameworks, and sovereign appetite for digital
infrastructure. Dubai serves as the flagship hub for scaling across the
GCC.

## Pipeline & Growth Targets

• Short-Term (2025–2026):  
Leeds (UK) pilot → Dubai flagship → Additional UK & EU sites under
feasibility.  
  
• Medium-Term (2026–2028):  
Portfolio of 10–15 projects across UK, EU, and GCC, scaling GPU capacity
into the thousands of H100 equivalents.  
  
• Long-Term (2028–2030):  
Global portfolio targeting \$1B+ AUM, diversified across clean energy +
AI compute, supported by tokenized LP vaults.

## Investor Value

• Diversification — Projects across multiple geographies reduce
political, regulatory, and operational risk.  
• Scalability — Modular infrastructure ensures rapid replication
site-by-site.  
• Yield Stability — Long-term contracts (GPU leasing + PPAs) provide
recurring, predictable returns.  
• ESG Impact — All projects powered by renewables, contributing
measurable carbon reductions and potential carbon credit revenue.

✨ EcoYield is not just a pilot or one-off project. It’s a scalable
platform designed to build a global portfolio of renewable-powered
compute farms, capturing exponential demand for AI infrastructure while
delivering transparent, tokenized yields.
