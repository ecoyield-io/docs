# Pre-Sale Participation — Early Access to Yield

EcoYield’s pre-sale is designed to reward the earliest participants not
only with governance tokens at the lowest entry tiers but also with
priority access to real yield from the very projects their capital helps
fund.

## How It Works

\- Investors in the pre-sale receive \$EYE tokens at the lowest
available pricing tiers.  
- A substantial portion of the funds raised in the pre-sale goes
directly into deploying our first GPU + renewable energy projects.  
- Once these projects are live, pre-sale participants are entitled to
access a share of the yield generated through EcoYield’s vaults,
reflecting their role in funding the initial build-out.  
- If tokens are withdrawn early from the vault, holders lose their
entitlement to future yield — ensuring strong alignment and long-term
incentives for staying committed.

## Why This Matters

\- Direct linkage: Your pre-sale participation isn’t abstract — your
capital builds real assets, and you share in their performance.  
- Priority access: Pre-sale participants are first in line for yield
once projects are deployed.  
- Long-term upside: \$EYE tokens carry both governance rights and
embedded access to vault performance, tying their value directly to
real-world infrastructure success.

## Investor Benefit

By joining the pre-sale, you are not only securing \$EYE at the lowest
possible entry price — you’re also embedding yourself into the long-term
revenue cycle of EcoYield’s infrastructure. This makes pre-sale
participation a unique, dual-opportunity:  
- Early governance token upside.  
- Priority access to project yield as the vaults go live.
